Donald Trump‚Äôs ineffective leadership gravely worsened the crisis that we are in and he is now taking advantage of it to subvert and destroy our right to vote and vote safely. Request a ballot early. Vote early.
Trump‚Äôs calculated dismantling of USPS proves one thing clearly He is WELL AWARE that we do not want him as our president. He‚Äôs chosen to blatantly cheat and put millions of Americans‚Äô lives at risk in an effort to hold on to power.

Whenever I feel like I‚Äôm wasting time I remeber there‚Äôs an entire community of wackos on Reddit who spend every day stalking Caroline Calloway‚Äôs every move
Please DM if you have any burning questions for her 
Who is Milo 
I‚Äôm sorry,  interviewed Caroline Calloway for the Cambridge Union?!? 
See you in an hour people.
At 6pm (BST) American social media personality and a graduate of St. Edmund's College,  will be interviewed by , UK and Europe editor for MEL magazine.
The event will be live-streamed from our YouTube channel  
So this evening I am going to be in conversation with Caroline Calloway 
Watching the  conversation between  and . Hussein was introduced as an ‚Äòonline phenomenon‚Äô. I see no lies.
And  ‚Äî complicated and divisive ‚Äî is entertaining. She is the unreliable narrator of a campus novel escaped from the pages and raging across Instagram, Cameo, and OnlyFans.
She said 
‚Äúyou forgot narcissist. you forgot toxic...friend. you forgot criminal. you forgot.......SLUT.‚Äù 
I got arrested lol 
I'm...b..back ???

I like Ian and Emily almost as much as my cat does not like ME 
Wait is this Ian as in Project Coffee? 
Yes, let‚Äôs do this. But you have to let my boyfriend  be in it with me because if you guys are no fun, at least I‚Äôll be spending two hours with one person I like 
Since George Floyd died cops have killed 120 ppl in 20 days. Black people are being hung. Women and children are being abducted and killed. The list goes on. Fuck sports and entertainment man. It‚Äôs time to really tackle all this shit. Sports a distraction right now.

There‚Äôs really no good time to announce this right now, but I‚Äôm writing a book about the rise of online creators and how the social media influencer became the blueprint for the modern entrepreneur 
Okay now THIS is funny ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ 
Please read this thread 
I wrote a 2000-word essay that‚Äôs running in Vanity Fair.  I am very proud of it. My editor made the whole process warm and enjoyable. I wrote the whole thing very fast, which is crazy to think about because sometimes 1000 words would take weeks and months to spill out of me.

Never expected Logan Paul to be the one setting an example for the entire influencer industry but here we are 
The outrage behind Emma Watson for simply being silent ; then putting a white border around a black image shows social justices mobs are after power and not solving issues.
It begs the question, Do they truly care about the causes they're inconsistently outraged about?
Trump‚Äôs stunt with the Bible seems bizarre for everyone who didn‚Äôt grow up in white identity Christianity. 
Please. Please. Read up on the Cult of the Shining City. He is messaging them that we‚Äôre in a holy war. You can‚Äôt afford not to know this right now.
This capitalist system is such a well oiled machine. It wins even when the ppl win. Bail support initiatives around the country are functioning and the prison system is raking in millions of dollars a day from our efforts.
I‚Äôve been getting a lot of questions from my non-Black friends about how to be a better ally to Black people. I suggest unlearning and relearning through literature as just one good jumping off point, and have broken up my anti-racist reading list into sections 
‚ÄúWhen there‚Äôs one clip you can turn away, when there‚Äôs two you start to get a better picture, when you see so many examples it‚Äôs impossible to ignore them as anomalies. Love this  piece on just how viral the police brutality compilation is
FUCK ME UPPPP WITH THESE VOCALS, TAYLOR SWIFT 
After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? ‚ÄòWhen the looting starts the shooting starts‚Äô??? We will vote you out in November.

I just realized that if Caroline Calloway didn't have a lot of people being mean to her on the internet, she'd have to have a pr person or something. Literally everyone who hates her is doing her pr for free. Fuckin shit man, I wish I was this good at schemes.

Caroline Calloway‚Äôs trolls are so oddly obsessed with her, I looked at their reddit and holy shit. How do functioning adults have time to catalog and scrutinize her every move? They even have a reading list based on books she‚Äôs read. Why not use that time for something you enjoy?

with all due respect to ms calloway i absolutely am a bitter old lawyer 
We talked influencers and capitalism with  
I interviewed  and she was both lovely and insightful, allowing me to tap into my college brain to discuss the symbiosis between influencers and capitalism. 
I mean, yeah, I spent the whole night explaining to my fianc√© who  was and really only captured his attention with her impeccable OnlyFans content BUT I did get the best advice on how to style my hair on my wedding day. So. WORTH IT. 
What Caroline Calloway needs to realize is that sex work is actual work and selling nudes isn‚Äôt just some fad to be a part of.
- someone who‚Äôs been selling nudes for 3 months as opposed to 2.
Idk how but I blame Caroline Calloway for this Lana Del Rey shit.
my goal for this gemini season is to restrain myself from getting in a twitter fight with caroline calloway
I‚Äôm glad Caroline Calloway and Lana Del Rey have figured out how to create intelligent work as women unlike the rest of these SLUTS

graduating with a 2.2 from Cambridge and trying to dunk on sex workers with it
My parents recently pointed out to me that some misinformation about them had been spreading online; it's since taken on a life of its own and morphed into petty internet gossip. I wish I hadn‚Äôt had to write this, but I wanted to make some things clear 
Caroline Calloway 
The  graduation cameo was quite the hit amongst my all-girls school senior circle of friends which for some reason I feel like is very on brand for all parties involved 
So I‚Äôll be taking the next week to listen and to reflect and to read and, most importantly, to do what my hardened, cancelled heart basically NEVER, EVER does
1) Read your comments
2) Ask questions. Namely, if you are a Cantab on OF could you please hmu? I‚Äôd like to be friends
I LIKE being someone who is using my platform to normalize sex work, so that it‚Äôs safer for everyone.
That being said, I also want to be a young woman who is gentle and empathetic and that‚Äôs hard to do with my guard up.
That sexually promiscuous women are ALSO intelligent is still kind of a radical idea and I like being living proof for why that shit is bananas.
I LIKE being an example that sex work is something that girls from any background can choose to pursue because it empowers them.
Criticism I‚Äôve received from my own communities. I can‚Äôt emphasize the amount of shit I‚Äôve gotten from people I went to Cambridge with. And yes. The VIOLENCE facing sex workers is more urgent. But shouldn‚Äôt I be able to talk about my own experiences with sexist stereotypes?
Overwhelmed with feedback from a marginalized community, a hard shell can back fire. It can close you off from ideas you should be open, too.
I don‚Äôt think all the criticism I‚Äôve received for joining OnlyFans is fair. But I also think I‚Äôve been too defensive and too focused on
However I would just like to take a moment to publicly thank  for coming at me with a softness and empathy that made me remember the importance of... Well, softness and empathy. When you‚Äôre being piled on by trolls a hard shell pays off. But when you‚Äôre being
Given my vast experience with being cancelled online (I almost wrote ‚Äúmy trauma from being publicly shamed‚Äù but then deleted because I thought ppl would mock me) my brain has re-wired itself to err on the side of skepticism when it comes to unsolicited feedback on my personality 
PS - I didn‚Äôt find any Cantabs, but I found a girl from Oxford and retweeted the link to her OnlyFans from my profileüíì
thoughtfulness in your reply, but you‚Äôve never been cancelled to the degree I have. Sincerely inviting random people to inbox me is something that makes my blood curdle. Stirs up a lot of trauma. I phrased my original tweet as a statement to see if I was corrected and I was!(1/2)
I said ‚Äúproved‚Äù because I phrased my original tweet as a statement. I don‚Äôt ask a lot of questions on Twitter. I make statements. I already get more random dms (mainly from trolls) than I can handle. I didn‚Äôt want to encourage more. I really appreciate your eloquence and (1/2)
If you look at my original tweet, you will see that your assumptions are incorrect. I said then I would be ‚Äúhappy to be proved wrong‚Äù because I WAS looking for other Cantabs to connect with. I knew it would be provocative tweet because ppl, like you, always assume the worst in me
I agree with everything you‚Äôre saying. But how do connect that statement to mine?
If your tweets are shown to more people, you are more able to sell them whatever you are selling. Elder millennials and their inability to navigate Being Online makes me sad.
My heart goes out to users of the internet who don‚Äôt realize that ‚Äúgetting ratioed‚Äù is IDEAL. The Twitter algorithm can‚Äôt tell whether engagement is good or bad. This app recognizes only numbers.
More replies = More likelihood that your future tweets will be shown to others 
Thank you, Mariam, for confirming I am NOT a snob

This is extra funny because I made out with this Mac during the rock bottom of my Adderall addiction when my West Village studio was filled with boxes.

I mean...he literally had to write about Ronan Farrow to get people to read his writing. 
TBH I preferred the Caroline Calloway article to this, so I think that really puts in perspective how meaningless this article is.
Imagine writing a whole article about Ronan Farrow when you could've just tweeted from the  account I'm jealous.

The real answer is that much of sex work is just marketing, and it turns out Caroline Calloway is really good at that. Same with Blac China.

Caroline Calloway is a vermicious knid and an easy target but that's all on purpose. Do not feed that troll, she thrives on it and figures out a way to monetize it. The worst thing you can say to her is nothing at all.
I need a new messy white woman to celebrate, so should I stan Caroline Calloway?

Umbrellas can be antisemitic. I didn‚Äôt know this, but now I do. If you‚Äôd like to educate yourself further, read this art historical commentary on an anyisemitic artifact from the collections of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum

You realize how misogynistic this is when you find out that Cambridge University has followed me for 5 years on Insta. Through Scamgate. Through Natalie‚Äôs article. They stayed with me.
But this week I started posting on OnlyFans and Cambridge was like, CC? We do not know her. 
Your claims that I‚Äôm an evil bigot happened in the last 24 hours, which I have already apologized for.
And for everyone saying that Cambridge unfollowed me because I‚Äôm an evil bigot, simmer the fuck down.
1.) I‚Äôm not an evil bigot.

2.) Cambridge unfollowed me five days ago when I first started uploading content to my OnlyFans.
You realize how misogynistic this is when you find out that Cambridge University has followed me for 5 years on Insta. Through Scamgate. Through Natalie‚Äôs article. They stayed with me.
But this week I started posting on OnlyFans and Cambridge was like, CC? We do not know her.

I'd never heard of Caroline Calloway before last week, but read the essay on her website and WOW. The irony for me is how she talks about being a habitual liar in the past, but now it seems she's being more honest than 99% of the people out there. Can't help but respect that.
The thing about addiction, like falling asleep or in love, is that you can never pinpoint the moment when you slide from one state of being into the next. It just happens. It just does. And then you‚Äôre gone.

I would say 90% of Megan and I‚Äôs texts are about TV, Caroline Calloway, and Europe. I feel this is all appropriate and evenly leveled. (The other 10% is usually complaints, talking about cheese, and just general love for one another. Oh and just saying ‚Äúhey FT?‚Äù back and forth). 
caroline calloway and me all had our ‚Äúnatalies‚Äù said this to us. this essay is actually making me go crazy

My favorite thing about dropping Part Two with all the receipts is that today‚Äôs the quietest my trolls have ever been.
I can‚Äôt wait for Part Three.
 it provides a full perspective, not discounting natalie‚Äôs experience in that relationship, but it gives better clarity on caroline‚Äôs experience during that time. and the exclusion of addiction and just summing up caroline as just a horrible person is a bad characterization imo

MOST IMPORTANTLY
Not a single person at any workshop was asked to bring food.
No one brought food.
I fed everyone.
STOP TAKING THIS SCREENSHOT OUT OF CONTEXT 
You said I told people to bring food to my events ; other lies. You weren‚Äôt the only reporter saying it at the time. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to demand coverage that‚Äôs....true.
I also respect me for surviving articles like yours. It‚Äôs been v difficult but here I am.
That entire Trump propaganda press conference was one of the most awful and disgusting things I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. Over 11,000 Americans are dead, countless sick and this whackjob is attacking Americans, cracking jokes and applauding his failures. Worst fake president ever.

should draw her own nudes and put them in an adult coloring book. She should pocket the money from those sales though.
For context The post of Madison‚Äôs that I was referring to was literally a post making fun of me.
Madison said lots of derogatory things about me over many months while I held back.
Finally I was like, Fuck you! After letting her walk al over me! Felt fair and good 
Um, no. I have receipts BECAUSE THIS IS MY LIFE.
You have receipts OF MY LIFE because you are not living your own.
I wish I could take all the hours my trolls spend scrutinizing my every move and force them to do some kind of community service instead 
One of the weirdest things about my trolls is that they all talk to me in this sweetly fake and simpering style. ‚ÄúCutie.‚Äù ‚ÄúSweetie.‚Äù ‚ÄúBb.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so worried about CC, etc.‚Äù
There is a reason most people hate Umbridge just as much as Voldemort. 
And the reason is that people who condescend‚Äîunprovoked‚Äîin a sugary and horrifying way are AWFUL

My trolls are tweeting at me that because I once panicked and blocked a LOVER and then unblocked and apologized to him the next day....... That my trolls now have the right to continue making burner accounts to harass me????
THE LOGIC THEY USE TO JUSTIFY THEMSELVES IS CRAZY 
thank you to my liberal arts education for giving me the skills to truly kill it in my  book club
if you remember when kids used to listen to Cab Calloway, not Caroline Calloway 
Everyone who has decided to performatively hate or be bored by Caroline Calloway is missing out on one of the greatest life-as-art-projects of the modern age.
i can‚Äôt stop thinking about caroline calloway‚Äôs nudes...not sexually, just philosophically
most of you will never /get/ caroline calloway. rest easy, dorks
If you are creating a burner account to talk to me because I blocked your main........ Don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to hear from you. Please respect this boundary.
Well  I don‚Äôt know if you NOTICED but I‚Äôm giving away all the profits from my Natalie response to CHARITY and I still have fucking BILLS to pay.

Aug 30, 2017 - I go public about Natalie on ig ; TAG HER

The way I explain this situation to people is that every knows my last name no one ever remembers Natalie‚Äôs 
The only way I can explain the Caroline Calloway story is by telling people she is a more well off Jenny Humphrey and Natalie is still the same old Vanessa.
What‚Äôs your username? I will make you the second person I have ever unblocked 
I will never forget the day when the lady with the best opinions opined THIS 
cancelling my labour membership and buying the caroline calloway response

Caroline Calloway is the sort of manic pixie dream girl every person who likes women has been chasing their whole life and I‚Äôm obsessed with her power
That‚Äôs  I‚Äôm the patron saint of Cambridge and chaotic good

Kim Kardashian walked so Caroline Calloway could fly a rocket ship to the fucking moon.
Am I an adult with college classes to worry about? Yes. Is there a pandemic going on? Yes. Am I still way too invested emotionally in ‚Äôs twitter and Instagram content? Obviously
Imagine your ex best friend writing an essay about the demise of your friendship + selling it to The Cut for 5k... then said ex bf writes a THREE PART response and raises 30k+ for charity. Caroline Calloway is iconic lol
Who.
Did.

Jesus fucking Christ I wish I could fine everyone like that and ban them not just from Twitter, but society itself. I‚Äôm so sorry that he said that to you
I have SOME THINGS I would like to say about 
The message behind  is so important and it grounds me during times of food anxiety.
Her bangs are flawless.
I admire her resiliency because I know how hard it is when the internet scrutinizes your every move.
At this point when I block my trolls I do it less for myself than for my followers who are being harassed and dragged into unnecessary shit in the comments

Lana del Rey and Caroline Calloway have done nothing! That we know of!
I thought Caroline Calloway wrote that cat person thing. I can‚Äôt get these people straight!
future history books will cite caroline calloway as the ultimate example of pre-covid society's nihilistic decadence
Where‚Äôs the think piece about how Caroline Calloway‚Äôs Natalie response heralds the rebirth of subscription media??
I published my newsletter about Caroline Calloway, cruelty, and kindness yesterday on , so it's more accessible. 
Ok, I've done all the research and I finally know who Caroline Calloway is. Whew! 
Hey, why is everything closed? Why is everyone in a mask?
Caroline Calloway‚Äôs energy rn is so impressive tho
Now that Caroline Calloway made 2 ranked lists of the guys she fucked in terms of hotness and sexual prowess I want to do the same
At this point when I block my trolls I do it less for myself than for my followers who are being harassed and dragged into unnecessary shit in the comments
caroline proving she's one of us by hating a guy named josh and hating even more a guy named will. a proletarian goddess, hero of the common people
  Caroline Calloway is a notorious troll from Manhattan.  Very shady character.  Has been to Europe.  Untrustworthy.
Do I love Caroline Calloway and respect her taking control of her body and posting her tits online? Yes. Do I also think she should have put it behind a paywall and grown rich off simp money? Also yes
Well  has been a hero of mine for years 
the only thing that can break this website right now is if jaboukie tweets about caroline calloway
The only thing worse than all the women hating ok boomer girl and Caroline Calloway are all the men being like yeah those ugly broads are just jealous 6/10 Twitter getting worked up. Sir, please go to jail
I don't talk about Caroline Calloway with any of my male friends, but we definitely all know what's going on
i‚Äôve realized me and caroline calloway have the same dream for there to be more movies and tv shows that take place at elite boarding schools

All the smartest ppl I know r like 'im a dumb bitch hahaha I luv cum' and all the  most ignorant ppl I know are like 'if we consider this, we simply must acknowledge that blalalalalla it's disheartening to to see x, y, z'

Duh

15th day of quarantine and i have begun stanning Caroline Calloway
catfishing all my lovers with the caroline calloway nude as i rapidly tack on mass
I looked through Caroline Calloway's timeline for 30 mins and I learned nothing about her except that she posted tits, and that she would like to interview Chapo for a fuck appointment.
They were good tits tho, and there was a lot of excited babbling in her feed, so I followed.

Absolutely, unironically obsessed with the fact that Caroline Calloway posted a list of all the men she‚Äôs ever slept with ranked by hotness and then ranked by how good they are in bed. The unhinged feminist icon I need.
Sorting the people I‚Äôve slept with by who knew most about how to make a girl cum AND THEN sorting them by what I enjoyed most......... It really makes you think. 
This won‚Äôt make sense to you unless you went to Cambridge circa 2016-2019, but putting Freddie I. as only the THIRD most beautiful person I have slept with is a huge fucking flex 
True story. The first name of the ‚Äúawful Cambridge guy‚Äù is....... Guy. Pronounced Gee in French. But still. Makes me giggle. 
But you‚Äôve never met me. This roast doesn‚Äôt make sense.
also I made a caroline calloway vs cruel intentions board on Pinterest........never has there ever been a more aesthetic aesthetic
yeah your tits are nice. But what about all the ass guys/gals? Help us out too babe.
not going to zoom class and no one can make me. instead i‚Äôm gonna sit in my desk chair and think about caroline calloway‚Äôs nipples
oh you ‚Äúmuted caroline calloway‚Äù? Cool. i just caught my 12th consecutive egg in a video game for children
I learned from the best. Her name was Natalie.

I take breaks from the simulation we live in by catching up on the Caroline Calloway drama. I no longer know what is real and what isn't
literally have only understood the whole caroline calloway thing for an hour but have already crafted my new personality around it
when i dont know what everyone is talking about on here I just make up reasons why theyre talking about it and accept it as fact. for instance, I think people are talking about caroline calloway because she posted a picture of her suckin a dogs penis.
‚ÄòWhy Jameela Jamil vilifying Caroline Calloway exposes complete hypocrisy‚Äô 
I originally hate-followed caroline calloway and it is with a heavy heart that I must report she‚Äôs funny as fuck
(
Or a 14.29% it‚Äôs not important to me to learn it in the first place 
Everyone knows that about halfway through the Chapo ep Caroline Calloway is thinking she's gonna bang Felix, but by the end Virgil will have completely ran away with it
It was a nude AMD an apology 
British people be like. I've seen  knockers. Corr!
the only thing that keeps me from going insane in this quarantine is the fact that caroline calloway posted her nudes
me trying to explain Caroline Calloway to my ex bf 
Weird because when I took the quiz you got a 91% match with Carrie Bradshaw but I got a 100% match with you. 
and i'm not gonna fucking lie my tits have been looking fucking excellent lately. not as good as caroline calloway's but like. good.
Anna Delvey is the best character who was never on Gossip Girl and Caroline Calloway is the best character who was never on Girls

caroline calloway posting her nudes when the world is already catastrophically horny because of quarantine is frankly irresponsible! if her tits cause the world to implode she should be canceled for real this time

Caroline Calloway posted that nude for the people who make fun of her for going to Pilates thrice a week
To pilate - A verb

Did you know Onlyfans takes 24-48 hours to verify your identity before your account goes live? I did. Can‚Äôt imagine how I figured that out tho......
Throughout all this we shouldn't forget that while influencers can serve as a punching bag for the internet, rich/privileged ppl all over are making similarly dangerous decisions to thwart public health guidelines and they too should be held accountable 
I wrote about influencers fleeing NYC for greener pastures 
Reminiscing on the time I overheard multiple people in Mexico City talking about the Caroline Calloway essay. Her reach... Boundless

Wow, Natalie finally gets to see Caroline Calloway naked
Good job **checks notes** stealing from charity 
The orthogonality of Caroline Calloway nipples is analogous to the relationship between Left and Liberal politics. While superficially belonging to a similar category, any attempts at fusing them together creates a grotesque dual nippled uni-boob that nobody wants

1 Trump signs the bill

But as long as were going to have federal covid relief it would be nice if people wouldnt buy the dumbest headlines. The bill provides FAR more than $600 in direct relief. It provides another $300B in PPP loans which will be used to pay employees. It provides extended UI.
Extraordinary. 
That doesnt mean the bill is good. The original CARES Act wasnt good. The original PPP program was tremendously flawed. Theres a solid case to be made that all covid relief should be state-based rather than federal thanks to differential covid lockdown standards.
The question isnt whether this bill is a crap sandwich then. Its whether it should have passed. Frankly Congress was going to pass a covid relief bill and Republicans got way more of what they wanted than Democrats did. McConnell simply outnegotiated Pelosi and Schumer.
The covid relief bill is indeed a crap sandwich. All bills now are. The size and scope of government is the problem; theres a case to be made that the earmark ban actually effectuates MORE pork barrel spending.

Americans over 75 should now get the vaccine alongside essential *frontline* workers.
This is an improvement. But it doesnt solve many of the concerns. 
These estimates are from Israel but striking vaccinate the 0.5% of people over 90 and total fatality risk drops 19%. Vaccinate the 2.5% over 80 and it falls by half. Vaccinate the 7.5% over 70 and it drops by 34. Age skew remains under appreciated.

The Problem With Underestimating How Much People Want to Be Together When millions of Americans reasonably show that family time is nonnegotiable it‚Äôs time for public health strategy to move beyond ‚Äújust say no or else you are a granny killer‚Äù.  
Amusing that an Axios exclusive on Swalwell being compromised by the Chinese has somehow been tacitly deemed a right wing news story.
Public Health Seattle spent weeks shaming you from visiting grandma for Thanksgiving claiming youd kill her if you did. Yet they also posted COVID sex advice online telling you to set up a homemade glory hole with a shower cuain. You cant make this up.
Human beings tend toward ultracrepidarianism. Often scientists think science solves all problems; politicians think politics solves all problems. In reality no single area of thought solves all problems and expeise in one area does not denote expeise in all areas.

Warnock‚Äôs refusal to denounce cou packing reminds me of Biden‚Äôs ‚Äútransition from oil‚Äù comment in the last presidential debate. That gave the Trump campaign lots of...er...fuel...for the last 2 weeks of the race. Expect the GOP will pound this issue in GA for the next month.

It blows my mind every time a conservative voices an opinion that‚Äôs deeply unpopular with their audience and then gets accused of being a ‚Äúshill‚Äù and a ‚Äúsell out‚Äù for it. Whether they‚Äôre right or wrong taking an unpopular stance is the exact opposite of shilling and selling out.

Both of these Biden statements are false. Getting back in the deal is easy -- waive sanctions  Iran will pretend it is complying. Done. And of course the US can stop Iran from getting nukes alone. His claim here is classic Obama-style defeatism masquerading as multilateralism.

Founded in 1823 the Lancet is among the worlds oldest and best-known general medical journals.
As far as setting time-bounded public health guidance this seems like a poor idea. Either the period is too long in which case people will simply stop complying or its too sho in which case people will stop complying. See e.g. 15 Days To Slow The Spread.
The science says wear a mask in crowded settings outdoors when you cannot socially distance and in indoor settings. It does not say that wearing a mask through April will be necessary or that the timeline should coincide with Joe Bidens First 100 Day mark.

If Facebook decides to turn over its news feed algorithm to the very legacy media sources people went to Facebook to avoid they deserve everything coming for them. The fact that Facebook has outsourced its credibility ratings to paisan groups of the Left is pathetic.

The movie was probably greenlit in the first wave of this might explain Trump feeling from Hollywood. By the time it came out the revisionists had won the conversation in the media. So the movie became Bad‚Ñ¢ along with the book.
Revisionists then decided the book was Bad‚Ñ¢ for three reasons 1 the book glorifies individual decisionmaking to break patterns of bad generational decisionmaking; 2 it treats povey culture as a non-intersectional problem; 3 it humanizes poor white Trump suppoers.
The revisionist history on the book Hillbilly Elegy is fascinating. The book came out in 2016 and was a massive bestseller because it personalized and commented on cultural pathologies that lead to long-term povey in rural white communities.
Any ‚Äúconservative‚Äù who does anything to disenfranchise or discourage voters in Georgia is a traitor a snake and an enemy of our movement. Holding the Senate is the only thing that matters right now. Catastrophic consequences if we lose it.
Looking at these Biden cabinet names...Lord save us. After Biden inevitably steps down why not just skip over Harris and make a Roman style triumvirate out of the Presidency and let Obama rule with both Clintons.
Ive seen Hillbilly Elegy. Amy Adams and Glenn Close are both terrific. The movie is a well-told family drama. The reason the critics are crapping all over it is simple the book was treated as humanizing Trump suppoers and is now a Bad Book‚Ñ¢. So the movie is also Bad‚Ñ¢.

Yes! Correct! Colleges exist as soing mechanisms. Youre paying for the degree so that potential employers and law schools can determine if you are sma or not. The poli sci classes themselves are essentially useless as anyone who has ever majored in poli sci knows.

Left Hey look how impoant and magical it is that Harry Styles is wearing a dress! Hes subversively undermining masculinity!
Right Yes men wearing dresses does undermine masculinity and thats bad.
Left HOW DARE YOU SAY MEN WEARING DRESSES UNDERMINES MASCULINITY?!
Pretending that men dressing like women does not feminize men is ridiculous paicularly coming from the same people who are celebrating Styles BECAUSE he is feminizing masculinity.
This holds true whether men wear kilts and women wear the earasaid or whether men wear pants and women wear dresses the argument that men in Scotland wear kilts so men in America wearing dresses isnt feminine is paicularly stupid.
If femininity and masculinity exist they have indicators. Dress has always been such an indicator. That‚Äôs why men wearing female garb has been a sign of femininity in viually all cultures for all time.
The Left knows this; they openly say that gender is both impoant and socially constructed which is why they tell you that a man can be a woman e.g. despite no biological underpinning.
The Left knows this of course. The POINT of Styles doing this photo shoot is to feminize masculinity. Otherwise why would it be headline-wohy for Styles to don a dress?
Masculinity and femininity exist. Outward indicators of masculinity and femininity exist in nearly every human culture. Boys are taught to be more masculine in viually every human culture because the role of men is not always the same as the role of women.
This is perfectly obvious. Anyone who pretends that it is not a referendum on masculinity for men to don floofy dresses is treating you as a full-on idiot.

So the narrative must be preserved even at the cost of looking like hysterical ninnies who treat Republican failure to say president-elect before the ceification of a single state vote as a constitutional crisis. Its a coup! Its a crisis! Bullcrap. Its not.
If that happens it will be obvious to everyone that the entire self-justifying media narrative has been a lie. It will be clear that their willingness to ignore facts in pursuit of that narrative was about political activism not speaking truth to power.
But it turns out that Orange Hitler wasnt in fact a threat to the republic. There is a legal process; it will take place; if the electors vote for Joe Biden a peaceful transition of power will take place.
The medias hysterical narrative about an incipient coup isnt about reality. Its about maintenance of the narrative that they were correct to abandon their journalistic credibility in pursuit of Orange Hitler because he was a unique threat to the republic and remains so.

Fascinating look at the struggle in the Democratic Pay. The left will prevail. They have the energy dynamism and conviction. The centrists are driven mainly by a desire to hold their own seats. Foune favors those fighting for what they believe in.
Wait what? A campaign that avoided interaction with the press and public and avoided discussion of the most impoant policy questions cou-packingfilibuster -- thats not an old fashioned campaign.  The opposite. 
At some point Dems are going to realize that they are almost ceainly stuck with Kamala who is so untalented and unlikable a politician she had to drop out of the Dem primary before *Iowa* as their nominee in 2024. All because of the identity politics they insist on.
Florida has done this voter ID required no same-day registration allowed earlyabsentees votes counted and usually completely posted an hour or so after polls close. One of the rare instances where we could all stand to learn something from Florida Man.

The decision by states to push mass mail-in balloting with no preparation prevent Election Day counting and ignore statutory deadlines on delivery created a cloud that may never pass.
Let‚Äôs Face It Mail-In Balloting Was A Disaster
All of those impatient to declare the election over arent helping anything here; the votes are all in and the election is already over. We have a legal process. Let the process work.
There are theories floating out there that Biden could get stripped of PA votes because the so-called segregated votes postmarked but not received by Nov 3 could be invalidated by SCOTUS. 
This is not true. All the votes being counted now are ones received pre-Nov 3.
The forcible removal scenarios have always been deranged and misunderstand Trump. 
Of course. Why on eah would she ever retire?

In light of Biden pull-ahead in Georgia much Democratic praise for Stacey Abrams. Indeed her conduct in 2018 governors race could become model for Trump post-election stance.

I dont care *that much* on how horse race polls are off except that perhaps it forced a misallocation of resources but a skew in public opinion polling is potentially a big deal. 
This genuinely should not be controversial. It is not a paisan statement. It‚Äôs the exact opposite of a paisan statement. 
LMAO! Defund the police and socialism drove MINORITY voters to vote in outsized numbers for Republicans. See e.g. Florida. 
Here‚Äôs how this must work in our great country Every legal vote should be counted. Any illegally-submitted ballots must not. All sides must get to observe the process. And the cous are here to apply the laws  resolve disputes.
Thats how Americans votes decide the result.
I dont buy every claim of voter fraud I see on social media and you shouldnt either. But neither do I dismiss election fraud as a concept outright especially with PA accepting mail in ballots three days later. The only way to ensure fairness and restore trust is to litigate.

GOP well-positioned for 2022 in the House and Senate. Bidens most progressive priorities are DOA in a McConnell-run Senate. But remember Democrats told you that their top priority was restoring the national soul by ousting Trump. Theyre sad today because that was a lie.
And this election did not give the Democrats power. Tuesday night was terrible for Dems. It broke their vision for an ascendant intersectional coalition. GOP will likely maintain the Senate. GOP will maintain the statehouses in a redistricting year. GOP gained House seats.
Fascinating to watch the mood from Democrats this morning. Even though they believe that Biden will win theyre sour. Thats odd because supposedly this election was all about getting rid of Orange Man Bad. But thats the diy secret it wasnt. It was about power.
Amazing!
Fox News this morning listed the states that are close and still counting  but refuse to list Arizona because they are too stubborn to admit they made a mistake. 
Dems had quietly mapped out plans - how to quickly pass massive covid relief then shoring up ACA climate taxes etc. 
Not to mention dreams of nixing fbuster expanding SCOTUS.
All that ran ashore as McConnell still wields power.

What a Mickey Mouse operation 
In PA Trump is up by approximately 454K votes. There are 1.12M votes outstanding; Biden needs 78% of those votes to win the state. 300K of those votes are in Philadelphia. Even if Biden wins 95% of those votes he still needs to pull 70% of the other votes. Thats a heavy lift.
In AZ Biden currently leads by approximately 93500 votes. There were 605K votes cast on Election Day. Trump would need to pull 57.73% of those votes to win. Team Trump says theyre pulling 62% in Maricopa County and 72-80% in other counties. Theyre projecting a 30k-40k win.
So here are the latest stats Im hearing via the Trump campaign -- and theyre sounding pretty confident that Trump has a serious shot at taking AZ and PA. 1

1 month ago ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very frustrating because it‚Äôs backed by so much money. And its been going on for two years now Non-stop negative ads. That eventually it pulls you down‚Äù Collins said. ‚ÄúWhats amazing is that I‚Äôm still going to win.‚Äù
Weird not seeing Twitter put a warning on this 
Biggest losers last night
1. Pollsters
2. The woke
3. The establishment media that endlessly promote both
Democrats today Maybe we should think about how to do better outreach to groups weve taken for granted.
Democrats tomorrow But what if we just call all our opponents racist?
Huge development - we didnt even get to ranked choice voting!

No you dont get to declare this. How many times do I have to f***ing say this? 
Media 2016 Maybe we should rethink how we understand these Trump voters.
Media 2017 Theyre f***ing racists and must be excised from polite society.
Media 2020 Maybe we should rethink how we understand these Trump voters.
How do you think the rest goes?
Dump the media.
I have switched my opinion and now think  is right and also I always did 
Shouldnt Twitter put a warning on this? 
Of the many obvious and simple things that liberals cant get their heads around and comprehend this one is the most embarrassing for them. 
After recount in 2011 race for WI Supreme Cou there was a swing of 300 votes. After recount in 2016 Presidential race in WI  numbers went up by 131.

The Trump campaign has announced they are requesting an immediate recount in Wisconsin after Joe Biden wins the state by 20000 votes.
In the 2016 Wisconsin recount the number of votes gained by Trump after the recount was a whopping 131 votes.
Maha MacCallum makes a great point on Fox News. Months of the media hammering on polls which showed Biden and Dems winning undoubtedly had an impact on the country and thus on the results of this election.
A very vocal but hopefully small segment of the left cling to their hate like nothing else. 
Everybody in mainstream circles scoffed at the idea of shyunder-polled Trump voters. Hahahahahaha

The result of the presidential race will be known after every legally cast vote has been counted.
Really tough year for the why doesnt the public trust expes? must be cognitive bias narrative
GOP pollster Public Opinion Strategies conducted a post-election survey last night of 1600 voters.  Among the findings
Nineteen percent 19% of Trump voters said they kept their suppo for Trump a secret from most of their friends compared to just 8% of Biden voters.
No you dont get to declare youve won the election. 
Don‚Äôt let him delete this tweet. This is the Pennsylvania AG üëáüèªüëáüèª 
This is a big deal. Not the biggest deal right now but it‚Äôs big and should get serous attention when the dust settles on the presidential. 
Difficult to see Biden winning GA. Trump leads by 103K with Fulton at 98%. DeKalb where Biden is already outperforming Hillary from 2016 is at 80% and its doubtful theres enough there in surrounding counties to overcome that deficit.
This is a terrible idea. Just awful. 
Wow. Republicans have won trifecta control in New Hampshire‚Äîdespite Biden carrying it by 8 points! 
After most public polls showed a dramatic senior shift to Biden Trump ends up winning 65-plus voters by three points
How in the world is Twitter censoring s tweet here? To say that we ought to be concerned about a 100% blue vote drop of over 100K votes is perfectly obvious. 
WOW 
Would be good news for Perdue and Loeffler

Sorry to beat a dead horse but Quinnipiac face-planted badly in a number of places in 2018 FL! yet pundits salivated over their bullshit again this year.

Pollsters economists epidemiologists. They are the mediaeval physicians of our age clever at coming up with explanations for what has already happened useless at forecasting the future.
Somehow Democrats found themselves LOSING Congressional seats in BLUE STATES in a Presidential year with massive record turnout and an historically unpopular Republican incumbent in office.
This is unheard of.
Modern American polling is dead and modern American pollsters should find another vocation so they stop wasting all of our collective time and helping to gaslight the media and American public.
That is a lie. He said We want all voting to stop. We don‚Äôt want them to find any ballots at 4 o‚Äôclock in the morning and add them to the list okay? In other words he doesnt want people VOTING after election day or fraudulent ballots delivered. Which is the law. 
WI Trump is +100k but there are 700k votes still to count
PA Trump is +700k but 1.8m to count
MI Trump is +300k but 1.8m to count 
NC Trump is +77k but 300k to count
GA Trump is +100k but 450k to count
Keep in mind those are mostly earlymail votes that favor Biden.
If its 1.5 million votes Biden would have to win 73 to 27 to close the gap. Possible I guess but still seems like a stretch given that most of the mail in ballot trends have fallen in the 60-40 range for Biden.  
feel stupid saying this but WI really feels like it could go either way ... its going to depend on how dispropoionately dem the absentee voters are in places like MKE Green Bay Kenosha Wauwatosa etc  along with whatever GOP votes are out there
Thanks to everyone who watched our coverage at  -- and thanks to all who paicipated in bringing it to you! Well be back at it fresh first thing in the morning with all the latest.
CNN‚Äôs  just admitted that Joe Biden needs to win 75% of the remaining votes to oveake President Trump in Pennsylvania.

ABCWaPo poll only off by 17 percentage points or so give or take 
Biden wins AZ but Dems are fairly set to lose TX-23 which was banked like a bearer bond for the Dems in almost every electoral forecast okay you brainiacs talk to me about this.
WI update with Trump up almost 120K over Biden not sure Biden can make that all up with MKE county absentees. there are other votes still out including from Kenosha and Green Bay and GOP votes still out there too. needless to say have heard bullish things from both sides.
No Trump has not already won the election and it is deeply irresponsible for him to say he has.

This matters. If Biden wins this electoral vote and Arizona Trump has to win Pennsylvania *and* Michigan 
Trump has won Zapata County ‚Äî just noh of the Rio Grande Valley along the border ‚Äî by 6 points 53% to 47% per SOS results.

So far Dems Senate hopes
* At least one GA runoff possibly two.
* Bullock has a shot.
* Gideon an underdog IMO but some unceainties in ME.
* We know nothing about Alaska yet.
* But wouldnt want to be Cal Cunningham though.
Another big hitch in The Narrative
Voters in California which is majority minority look set to vote down a ballot measure that would allow state agencies and universities to engage in affirmative action by a clear majority. 
CNN is painting Bidens statement of victory as casual it wasnt while Trumps response was disturbing it wasnt.
This fight is going to get very ugly. 
Anyone who believed the pollster bro narrative this year about double digit leads for Biden in states he ultimately lost should stop writing about politics. Theres a point where you should realize youre just not good at this.
We need you to talk a lot less.

Wokeness is unfalsifiable. But this comes close. After four years of white supremacy Trump doubled his vote among black women and saw gains among all Latinos.

Biden doesnt *need* those states but Trump taking them makes this much closer than the polls were predicting and it will all come down to the midwest.

Most analysts think Florida is going really well for Trump even though Biden currently leads 50.4% to 48.7%.
What explains the discrepancy?
- Nothing in yet from heavily-R panhandle.
- Current vote is earlymail. Election Day vote will be strong for Trump.

Pretty massive news the largest county covering Atlanta will have its results delayed significantly... might not have full results for Georgia until Wednesday 
Donald Trump only got ~334k votes in Miami-Dade in 2016. Already with 84% of the vote in this year hes drawn ~457k.
Holy Miami-Dade Batman.
Weve always known FL Hispanics esp south FL Hispanics dont behave politically like Hispanics elsewhere so we shouldnt extrapolate out from this.
But Trump has clearly made huge gains w Cuban vote and is sitting pretty in FL because of it.
Yikes. This is not a good sign for Biden. 
The latest results 
The advanced vote in Florida weve seen so far will probably be to the Trump campaigns liking and it augurs for a tighter race than the pre-election polls given that the Democrats underperformed a bit on Election Day

Chuck Todd just said Democrats told him they need a 17 million vote turnout in Texas to win. I can‚Äôt even fathom that is possible. That‚Äôs almost 200% of 2016 turnout.

Taking your calls right now at 855236-3228 on the election -- and lets hear your anecdotal evidence if youre from a swing state!
Ive opposed the rallies. Theyre dumb and counterproductive. Biden and the Democrats declared racism a public health crisis so urgent it required millions to gather in the streets in close proximity.
This doddering 78-year-old career politician who suppos aboion-on-demand and has switched nearly every major political position he has ever held while simultaneously looking the other way as his family enriches itself off his name will save our souls! is a weird take.
If you think electing Biden will save our collective soul get a little God in your life.
I ripped Trump many times for downplaying the virus paicularly in the early days. I think right now the greater danger is the mythmaking that a solution to covid is only a lockdown or a mandate away.
In the lead up to what were told every day is the most impoant election of our lives the New York Times hasnt run a single OpEd by someone voting for Trump as far as I can tell correct me if Im wrong. What an absolute failure on the pa of the former paper of record.
Yesterday my wife shared this message of tolerance between Democrats  Republicans.
She got over 500 quote tweets from outraged paisans saying we must utterly hate the other side.
Viually all this was from Democrats demanding hatred of Republicans. #HateSpeech 
So once youre in office you will relieve us of sin? Our souls will be purged? Bidens campaign is ovely paganistic nonsense. 
1 Weve done better on deaths per million than Belgium and Spain were in the same ballpark as Italy and the UK and France is now spiking as is Germany. 
2 Trumps politicization is undeniable. So is Democrats.
3 Bidens plan is Trumps. Rhetoric is the difference.
By the way everyone should read Applebaums work on Soviet Russia. Because its actually indispensable.
1 Shops are being boarded up in preparation for Democrats rioting;
2 Democrats are gaming out ways of taking the White House see John Podesta;
3 Democrats are already claiming if he wins its because of phantom voter suppression. 
Proud to call ‚Å¶‚Å© a friend. 
How do we know this will happen? Because the media did the same thing with Wundergovernor Andrew Cuomo who has the second-worst deaths-per-million rate in the nation. He mandated masks on the downslope of the curve then claimed credit for the downslope. And the media cheered. 
Cases will continue to decline as they were already doing; he will then claim credit for having crushed the virus having actually accomplished viually nothing. The media will play along because the Trump-as-covid thesis is religious and unfalsifiable.
So heres my prediction if Biden wins the cases will spike this winter as they are doing. The deaths will follow but at not nearly the rate of MarchApril. This will begin to wane by January. Biden will then declare a mask mandate constitutional or no.
Biden is promoting mask mandates tried in Europe failed. Hes promoting testing and tracing absolutely useless in a country of 330 million people with 100000 positives a day and community spread. People should act responsibly. But thats not a top-down solution to covid.
We keep hearing that Democrats know how to shut down this virus. Were even hearing that so of language from Fauci who is saying that Biden is taking covid seriously from a public health perspective. But Biden has no solution. Neither does anyone else.
There is a myth that has now been built into this election that Trump is a miasmatic evil force a blight that will when lifted from the land take with it covid. Trump IS in this vision covid. Thats silly. But its ceainly the feeling being pushed by media and Democrats.
This Just In Dicks are for Trump Karens are for Biden

If they close the Oveon Window on behalf of the woke Left they undermine free speech and a free press but come closer to their policy utopia. This is the choice at hand. Its pretty obvious which way mainstream liberals are moving. And thats disastrous for the country.
If they open the Oveon Window enough to have conversations with those with whom they disagree they preserve free speech and a free press but at the cost of having to debate the road to utopia.
The only way it stops is if liberals recognize that the commitment to free speech and a free press -- supposedly their core principles -- ought to trump their commitment to utopian democratic socialist outcomes.
Its the social climate created by the woke Left and their allies of convenience in liberal circles that provides the basic framework for the complete collapse of social cohesion.
This has real ramifications for individual Americans -- in many cases ramifications far more grave than tax policy. It forces silence at risk of loss of friends and family. It demands compliance with ever-changing woke standards on penalty of firing.
Democrats and the media but I repeat myself as well as cowardly corporations have made the case that to dissent from the prevailing Leftist line is racist sexist and homophobic.
Some in the media keep questioning why people focus on cancel culture. Its because there are two ways politics affect our lives first policy affects our lives; second social ostracization on the basis of political preference affects our lives.

The media are correct to critique Republicans who argue that if Trump loses its because of voter fraud. The simultaneous willingness of the media to promote a narrative that if Trump won votes were suppressed is disgusting.
In other words whoever wins the election Biden or Trump will be legitimately elected barring extraordinary circumstances. Those extraordinary circumstances have simply not been proved in advance. The evidence isnt there.
Cous ruling that executive branch officials cannot unilaterally rewrite election law Minnesota or that state cous cannot unilaterally override statute simply because of covid Wisconsin is not voter suppression.
We are going to see record voting this year. More votes than prior presidential elections by leaps and bounds. Standing in line to vote and then voting is not voter suppression. Driving to a drop-off box and voting is not voter suppression.
Theres a lot of talk about Republicans focusing on voter fraud. I think that a lot of the talk about voter fraud is wildly overheated. Im also noticing that the same media decrying such overheated talk are rabidly repeating that voter suppression is a major issue. It is not.

Everyone I disagree with is racist is a winning message. Keep saying it over and over .
Democrats have never provided an alternative plan with regard to COVID. Bidens stated plan -- to accelerate a vaccine to socially distance to mask more to create local authority for targeted lockdowns -- is no different from Trumps.  
Alternatively we have ovely laid out our cases with regard to 2020 and remained heavily critical of Trump when we feel its deserved. But keep calling everyone you disagree with racist. Thats definitely going to convince me to vote for Biden. 
Feel the wrath of Twitter Ben.

In other words those who are saying that Biden will represent a renewed stasis are wrong. Biden has moved to appease the prevailing winds on every major political issue. And those winds blow strongly to the radical Left in his own pay.
Nothing makes Joe Biden a transformational figure. But nothing makes him a bulwark against transformation either. His career has always been about absolute ambition pockmarked by utter incompetence and thorough dishonesty.
his absolute and utter wrongness on every major foreign policy issue of the last half-century; his bloviation and gaffes which were so bad they repeatedly sank his ambitions. If Biden represents a return to normalcy thats because the Old Normal was corrupt and venal too.
There are several themes to Joe Bidens five-decade career his willingness to shift positions with a change in the wind; his willingness to let his family take advantage of his political position and his willingness to cut the usual DC sweethea deals with friendly companies;

Theyre suggesting lockdowns WHO disagrees. Theyre suggesting mostly that Trump is a miasmatic evil who is preventing a solution. But heres the reality there is no easy solution. End of story.
But the media have set up a mythical solution that would be implemented absent Trump. Theyre suggesting federal mask mandates Italy imposed a mask mandate outside and in with fines up to $1000 on October 8 and theyre experiencing 20000 positives a day.
So Meadows said a perfectly obvious thing you cannot control the pandemic spread when there are 70000 new cases per day. Lockdowns delay they do not squash. You can mitigate. Thats true in Europe. Thats true here.

NYTs FACT CHECK
On Trumps claim that wind turbines kill birds-
False at least when it comes to the birds.
Birds that fly into the spinning blades of wind turbines DO DIE IN LARGE NUMBERS...570000 each year. But turbines do not number among the greatest threats...
This is true for anything a politician says will happen if they or their opponent wins.

That women outnumber men in every conceivable educational metric proves nothing. We will only eradicate institutional sexism in the universities when not a single man is allowed on campus. Then we shall have true equity. 
So pa of the reason why Trumps effo to press Biden on phasing out the oil industry was effective is Biden has repeatedly said he would do just that. But thats also why its unlikely to be as resonant as Rs want it to be. If youre a fossil fuel voter your ticket is clear.

Hes blitheringly hacktastic. Biden had the biggest lie of the night bar none that Obamacare didnt result in anybody losing their health insurance plan. That was such a whopper it was Politifacts Lie of the Year in 2013. 
I guess Krugman got bored with blaming Trump for all the Covid deaths so now hes shifted to placing at least some of the blame on...Ayn Rand -- who died in 1982 
I highly doubt the debate changed anybodys mind. The only question is whether it gave Trump-shy Republicans an excuse to vote for him -- which may help in close states and in Senate races as well.
This is absurd. I read all of the coverage yesterday thinking he was seen on cam pulling a Toobin. Now having watched it it really does appear as if he was tucking in his shi as he said. I get that many don‚Äôt like him-but this B.S. is just wrong.

How different would this race be right now if Trump had shown up and performed like this in the first debate?
Trump just got Biden to say he wants to end the oil industry. Wild.
Hey  #Debates2020 
Biden isn‚Äôt telling the truth about what he‚Äôs said on fracking. Trump played a montage of Biden  Harris comments on fracking at a PA rally this week!
WINDMILLS WILL SAVE US!
We had a Republican Congress says Biden. Wrong. The House flipped Republican in 2010 the Senate not until 2014.
Fact check climate change is not an existential threat to humanity.
Trump doing a good job of hammering Biden on being a typical politician.
Trump hit his stride with ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you get it done‚Äù but isn‚Äôt including his 35 years as a Senator and should have been hammering this all campaign. He hasn‚Äôt.
President Trump did not condemn the poor boys.
Welkers question here -- bringing up every gross Trump comment and tweet -- will absolutely not be mirrored by a question on Bidens you aint black nonsense Im sure.
Biden is making up nonsense about Russia here.
Its about accumulating the oppounity to have wealth as well as being free from violence. - Joe Biden on the objectives of a campaign to eradicate institutional racism.
Biden ‚Äúthe fact of the matter is there is institutionalized racism in America.‚Äù
DT he‚Äôs been in gov‚Äôt 47 years he never did a thing but label some ‚Äúsuper predators.‚Äù
America has never perfectly lived up to its ideals. No one ever has - well none but one. But we have LED THE WORLD in our ideals.
This Welker question about race and policing is absurd.
Trump is absolutely correct on catch-and-release policies.
If you guys could see how much popcorn  is eating right now...

The kids came with *adults* but not necessarily their parents.
So we should force businesses to raise the minimum wage because were already bailing them out? Thats insane.
Trump has a great line there how are you helping small businesses by setting a higher minimum wage?
I dont see red states and blue states says Biden ignoring that the state bailouts are generally directed at blue states.
Come on is the most overused phrase of the evening. Which shows Biden isnt doing paicularly well.
Trump is exactly correct about Pelosi stonewalling covid aid.
Apparent bipaisan agreement on not reforming entitlement programs. Ugh.
Biden crapping all over Bernie is rather hilarious.
Biden has dramatically changed his public option plan tonight.
The internet remembers.
Biden obviously losing steam.
Biden says he suppos private insurance but he also suppos the public option which is a mechanism that will drive private insurers out of the market by undercutting on price through subsidies.
Not a single person lost their insurance under Obamacare? This is patently untrue.
. has also said he would reopen the Palestine Liberation Organization mission in Washington DC and resume U.S. aid to Palestinians which President Trump revoked because the aid was being used to suppo terrorism #Debates2020 
Welkers framing on this ACB question is ridiculous. Her appointment is not about oveurning Obamacare.
We had a good relationship with Hitler?
This rehearsed move from my family to your family was weak. Trump blasted him on it and it was rather hilarious.
Joe Biden falsely claimed tonight his son never made any money off of China. He did after taking a ride with Joe on Air Force Two.
Welker should not have cut Trump off on the China allegations. Thats absurd.
Not heard from Biden those emails are fake. The laptop isn‚Äôt Hunter‚Äôs.
Biden says Hunter didn‚Äôt make money at all from China? Really?
Welker overall doing an excellent job thus far.
The Big Guy says hes never taken a penny from a foreign country. Will that stoke media interest and will they look at what Hunter was pulling in?
Trump is right. ObamaBiden gave pa of Ukraine to Russia.
Biden ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken a penny from any country ever.‚Äù
I think you owe the American people an explanation...
The different tone is astonishing. So Trump can help himself at least for a while it seems.
Trump is amazingly on message.
No family member or other person has ‚Äúheld stock for Joe Biden.‚Äù Well now that doesn‚Äôt quite answer the Q does it? Did Hunter collect $$ meant for dad? Strike a deal to do so?
That they may not have been ‚Äúin business‚Äù together as claimed below dn answer these Qs at all. 
This + other messages appears to corroborate that Hunter did refer to his dad as ‚Äúthe big guy‚Äù and ‚Äúmy chairman‚Äù ‚Äî and that Joe Biden has not been telling the truth about his knowledgeinvolvement on such dealings ‚Äî but also that Joe vetoed a dodgy deal at least in this case? 
Once ‚Äî like last year ‚Äî it was considered perfectly appropriate for liberal journalists to dig into Hunter Bidens ethical lapses  dubious business arrangements. The subject only became verboten when Biden became the Democratic nominee.

Like Im sorry to get so explicit about it but thats obviously what happened here. Oh baby Im so turned on etc. etc. Gross but whats even grosser is the likely answer to the question was that other woman his wife or not?
Because cmon its Jeffrey Toobin.
This is the true Occams Razor explanation 
We all know what Toobin was doing on Zoom right? He had two Zoom windows open one was his workplace election wargame the other was some lady he was video-sexing with and thinking his other camera off he tilted the screen down to show the lady he was...enjoying himself.

I dont even care about the substance of the story at this point. People who care about excessive and politically-motivated censorship need to share this just to make it clear that this type of censorship will backfire. 
Trump talks about how stuff he doesnt like is fake news. You say this is a threat to the press. Then you actually treat news you dont like as fake news and suppress it before fact-checking it. You are everything you supposedly despise.
The fact that Twitter somehow decided via internal process that it wasnt ok proves it wasnt ok is a take that should worry you paicularly if you suppo Biden.

The internet allowed the flourishing of alternatives to the mainstream media. The mainstream media have abandoned their supposed allegiance to the First Amendment in pursuit of their former monopoly on narrative and informational dissemination.

Its social media companies staffed by Democrats determined to do good by preventing the dissemination of disinformation -- by which they often mean narratives and stories they dont like.
Its Democrats blackmailing social media companies with threat of legislation should those social media companies allow free dissemination of alternative narratives.
The real story isnt Bidens alleged corruption. Its the Democrat-social media-journalistic triangle dedicated to preventing dissemination of information they dont like. The true danger to a free press and free speech aint Trump. Its this.
Once I asked a friend who works for Facebook how its conscionable that FB lets so much misinformation spread. She said the alternative is worse cant have Mark Zuckerberg deciding what info you have access to. After seeing what Twitter pulled yesterday Im seeing her point. 
I laughed. Because it‚Äôs lightheaed and human. If leftism means sucking the joy out of most interactions then congratulations. Everything is a micro aggression. 
Honestly we already knew the entire Biden family was trading off Joes name. The big story isnt even Biden here. Its the willingness of social media to act as block and tackle for the Biden campaign.
Holding out the prospect of trading on your power in order so that your family can get richer is corrupt behavior. This is the Clinton Foundation model. A policy deliverable would make the activity criminal; the lack of a deliverable merely means its deeply unsavory.
Biden didnt need to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired on Hunters behalf for corruption to be in play. Holding a meeting with an unsavory Ukrainian oligarch so your son can pick up bags of cash while you are VP with authority over Ukraine is in and of itself corrupt.
Twitter is not censoring access to this new Post story. Which means according to their own new rules - The story is accurate. The emails are authentic. The materials were not hacked. 
If you want to be a journalist perhaps you ought to know that originalism isnt about fealty to churning butter you utter f***ing idiot

Kind of blows a giant hole in why the debate commission made the second debate viual. 
EXCLUSIVE In a new national poll commissioned by  83% of Ohodox Jews say theyre voting for President Trump while 13% are voting for VP Biden.
This marks a 29% swing in favor of Trump since 2016.

  The bottom line is that Twitter specifically cites a need for the material to be authorized and theres no way Trump authorized them and whether we like it or not they are his records to authorize any release.
Right but their standard is designed to prohibit the use of our service to distribute content obtained without authorization. Who authorized the release of Trumps tax records?
In 2018 a series of damaging stories about longtime GOP donor Elliott Broidy appeared in the New York Times and WSJ. 
The stories were largely based on emails most likely hacked by Qatari intelligence. 
Based on Twitters very broad policy...shouldnt those stories be blocked? 
Remember when four CNN journos repoed that Comey was about to testify that he didn‚Äôt assure Trump that he wasn‚Äôt under investigation?
That didn‚Äôt happen. CNN retracted with egg on its face.
But did TwitterFacebook censor the story? Nope!

From an insider not politically connected The emails in the NY Post story have been verified -- they‚Äôre solid. The Vadym Pozharskyi email address has historical data dating back to 2014. Fuhermore it is registered to the address of Burisma.
Translation outlets should censor any information Ben Rhodes doesnt like 
I would love to read an essay on the ever-morphing definition of misinformationdisinformation. Seems that it has gone from being a description of Holocaust denialanti-vax to a word to tag any content that seems to help the political right? 
This describes the NY Times Tax Trump story to a tee. 
Yeah you can make the case that the pressure wasn‚Äôt about protecting Burisma or wasn‚Äôt improper. But you can‚Äôt say it didn‚Äôt happen. Biden boasted of it in public on tape. 
Thats not journalism. Its paisan activism. It should be treated as such.
Its a lie. And its an obvious lie. But it doesnt matter. All that matters is that social media companies close off access to non-traditional-media thereby recreating the oligarchy of the mainstream media.
This is the kind of crap pushed weekly by Kara Swisher and Kevin Roose at The New York Times. They routinely tweet out lists of highly-trafficked pages on Facebook in order to not-so-subtly imply that Facebook is gaming the system on behalf of conservatives and Trump.
Ever since Clinton lost in 2016 many in the press have suggested that free dissemination on social media is the problem. They have pressured social media to re-impose from the top down the so of monopoly on informational dissemination that existed pre-internet.
Lets also be clear about one paicularly horrifying fact the social media crackdown on the  story is the kind of action our journalistic betters have been *begging* for. Our press arent First Amendment advocates. Theyre openly in favor of censorship.
This -- Twitters description of Bidens actions in Ukraine -- is not true and not even disputed.
Biden absolutely pressured the Ukrainians to fire the prosecutor. Hes said so himself.
What if your actions were garbage not just your communications? 
‚ÄúWe have a communications problem‚Äù execs say when actually there‚Äôs a fact problem.
Thats a game that isnt going to end well. Not for social media companies. Not for free and open competition. And not for our politics.
The Left has no qualms about using government to control social media. Many conservatives do. When social media companies act as paisan censors on behalf of the Left then theyre spitting in the eye of the very people they require to stand up against government control.
Thats a good long-term argument. The problem is that our politics is no longer long-term. Which means that tolerance for competition -- and the time competition requires to set up alternatives -- has been dramatically eroded.
Now Twitter is trying to walk back its original rationale. Good luck. The American people were asked to give these social media companies the benefit of the doubt and to trust in the workings of the free market above the predations of any government board.
Based on a variety of shoddy rationales both Twitter and Facebook prevented dissemination of the story PRIOR to any fact-check. Twitter staed suspending people who tweeted out the link. This is pure unbridled insanity.
So just to get today straight the  repoed a leaked email in which a Ukrainian businessman thanked Hunter Biden for brokering a meeting with Joe. Joes campaign denied that any meeting was on the schedule then admitted that Joe *might* have interacted with him.
Will  censor us too? 
Our communication around our actions on the  aicle was not great. And blocking URL sharing via tweet or DM with zero context as to why we‚Äôre blocking unacceptable. 
Im going to delete and clarify something I dont really believe the Hunter Biden thing is a huge scandal. But my opinion about it is entirely separate from my opinion on Twitter and Facebooks attempts to censor it  censor those who try to share it. Its not Alex Jones stuff.
Give us ten examples of you doing this to mainstream repoing or GTFO.

Politico Biden‚Äôs campaign would not rule out the possibility that the former VP had some kind of informal interaction with Pozharskyi 
A politician famous for BS attacks made a BS attack and a dictionary edited itself to back up that attack.

To be clear the sexual preference attack is a bad faith contrivance. The evidence its advocates present in its defense doesnt hold up. We are to deny truth as we knew it 48 hours ago in deference to the new pay line. That is totalitarianism.

This is a typical DC swamp statement from Biden spox .
There‚Äôs a big difference between an official schedule and a personal non-official schedule. 
This means you are a bigot Bridget. Also it is a stain on America that we have never had a female president because men and women are different.
And then we did this thing called a Constitutional amendment. Which is in the original Constitution. You could even look it up! 
A source familiar confirms  scoop that Bruce Ohr resigned from DOJ before being fired over findings in the IG repo. Source says he resigned within past couple of weeks.
I sincerely didn‚Äôt know ‚Äúsexual preference‚Äù was considered problematic until I heard The Daily today. I‚Äôve also heard it argued that it‚Äôs insulting to render orientation as innate as tho one would choose differently if one could. There‚Äôs just got to be some grace in all this.
This is the unlikeable side of Sen Klobuchar and Im surprised she went there. Ridiculous to suggest ACB cut a deal with POTUS on the ACA. Shes said flat out it didnt happen no reason to doubt so why try to build weak circumstantial case that it happened?
This is insane. We have not fact-checked this story yet but it is eligible for fact-checking so we will pre-emptively reduce its distribution because blue check Twitter has the sadz isnt a standard. Its propagandistic top-down informational control.
Men and women are different. I will die on this hill.
Too bad you didn‚Äôt fact check the Steele Dossier. Could have saved us 3 years of absolute disgraceful nonsense. 
So what exactly is your standard for reducing distribution for stories on Facebook BEFORE they are fact-checked? Its bad enough after they are fact-checked by garbage organizations like Politifact. 
Oh I forgot when spread is high in Ohodox Jewish communities its the fault of their communal practices; when spread is high among ethnic minority communities its the fault of systemic American racism.
Now lets hear him talk about the cultural practices of other communities in which spread levels are high. Thats how this works right? 
And yes idiots its for no reason. They did it a week in advance they did it without talking with any medical professionals and Trump has now had multiple negative covid tests.
11 years ago today John Mayer was asked his thoughts on health care in an interview and he replied ‚ÄúHave you ever heard me play guitar? Im really good. You know what Im bad at? Answering questions about public health care.‚Äù
Better times.
If youre angry that NBC News is now doing a townhall with Trump while ABC News is doing a townhall with Biden perhaps you should mostly be angry at the idiots at the Commission on Presidential Debates who declared a Zoom debate mandatory for no reason.`

jesus christ what a year
Somewhere in between  Dems are turncoats for not filibustering the NDAA  and  it's Repubs whatcha gonna do  is the idea that it would've been good politics to at least deny enough votes to force Perdue and Loeffler to leave the campaign trail in Georgia    
the republican strategy 
if you're a corrupt, unlikable, out of touch, robotic multi millionaire elitist - just crank up the dial of racism, shoot some guns, claim you love god, wear a hunting vest, defend donald trump no matter how silly he is and these hogs will vote for you. 
kelly loeffler is rich republican white lady racist, not kkk racist. which is why i think her team deliberately placed her around the kkk dude to make her seem more georgia, she can just disavow later but the message will be sent. it's no different than her denim america flag hat
you can see days or weeks (8/21 lol) where i didn't stream since I first strapped on a camera on my ps4 and started broadcasting on twitch on 3/23/2018  
anyways its cheesy as fuck to say this but i always wanted a place for myself on the internet since i started doing on camera content at tyt, and i never really felt like i was able to build my own space there - and i'm really glad i found it at  
because of my community i was able to stream everyday for the past 365 days at an average of 10 hours a day. and it wasn't like a bet or a challenge, i literally noticed this a couple weeks ago after the election coverage. probably not the healthiest thing.  
2020 started with me leaving tyt  amp; going full time on twitch. it was chaotic with the primaries, losing fish during covid lockdowns, blm protests all the way to my first ever election coverage. I love the community i was able to build along the way. w/o them this wouldn't be fun
hell yeah brudder

Mitch McConnell is a heartless dried up ghoul. The only reason he is still alive is because he gathers life force from all Americans dying of poverty.
dude youre so fucking insanely stupid please stop. he's the president elect. the rest of the party is already doing the right things. all people should expect is for him to recognize their efforts. it's not even just bernie. it's pelosi and schumer as well.
democratic voters should remember that joe biden is not doing the bare minimum atm to win the ga runoff races. all he needs to do is mention mitch mcconnell and senate republicans as the sole obstructionists standing between americans and 2k in their time of need. disgusting.
imagine not using this opportunity to make a case for why people should be voting for democrats in the upcoming senate race in georgia.  
so far he has thanked republicans for passing the cares relief. and even chris christie for promoting mask wearing. still no mention of the cash act and republicans standing against it.
did no one tell joe biden that there's a ga senate runoff race centered around a HUGE winning issue for democrats? his conference is rehashing old talking points about his 100 day challenge where he'll ask people kindly to wear masks and shit. not a mention of 2k payments

Here's what Bernie Sanders and the Democrats are planning for the next few days in the Senate. If Mitch McConnell doesn't give them a floor vote on $2,000 checks, they can keep Senators in Washington through New Year's Day.  
republicans are currently defending foreign aid in our military budget, while simultaneously shitting on $2k in direct payments to the american people.
That‚Äôs okay with me.
Alternatively, if conservatives are suddenly so concerned w/ the cost of the bill, maybe they should focus on stripping their cushy tax giveaways for 3 martini lunches and thoroughbred racehorses instead of blocking critical support for working people.   
every republican argument against 2k in direct payments can be reduced to,  the slaves musn't know they can get more out of us, they will rebel in the future if you allow them to believe they deserve more. now get back to work.

the white dude who bombed nashville is a terrorist in our current colloquial understanding of the word. but the term itself is absolutely a political one that is wielded by those in power in an unconscious or conscious effort to create stereotypes which necessitate imperialism

trump is ready to blow up the stimulus claiming he wants ppl to get $2k exclusively because republicans abandoned him on the election theft. good. who cares. also nancy pelosi is actually doing a decent job showing who's standing between americans and $2k.
Republicans  objectively against you getting $2,000.
Looks like Pelosi will need to set an actual vote then.

rand paul is so fucking dumb  
Based on a lot of tweets I‚Äôm seeing, it seems like a *lot* of people have no idea whatsoever that House Democrats passed a *$3 Trillion* bill back in May. 
It included $1200 checks for each adult and each dependent in a household up to 3. ($4800 for a family of four) 
New  In May, Sen. Loeffler made a behind-the-scenes push against D proposals to halt negative credit reporting b/c of COVID
Soon after, her husband's co. (which she has $9M in stock in) capped a $10B acquisition of a major player in consumer credit data
idk why i did this

this is absolutely an insane way to do politics, fuck it i‚Äôm game.
Right now Obama is making calls to make sure we only get $600
Let‚Äôs do it.   and I already co-wrote the COVID amendment for $2,000 checks, so it‚Äôs ready to go.
Glad to see the President is willing to support our legislation.
We can pass $2k checks this week if the Senate GOP agrees to stand down.     
Republicans repeatedly refused to say what amount the President wanted for direct checks. At last, the President has agreed to $2,000 ‚Äî Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let‚Äôs do it!

ofc kyle is the other cofounder of jd and he is an advocate for forcing a vote on m4a but he too is also frustrated about the constant infighting amongst the podleft and their twitter stans.

This is why Congress needs time to actually read this package before voting on it.
Members of Congress have not read this bill. It‚Äôs over 5000 pages, arrived at 2pm today, and we are told to expect a vote on it in 2 hours.
This isn‚Äôt governance. It‚Äôs hostage-taking.

Last thing I‚Äôll say about the Medicare for All floor vote fight but my instinct is that if you want to take a page out of the Tea Party‚Äôs book, a more effective way would be to get 20 or 30 people together and go to your reps‚Äô town hall meetings and just scream at them about it

not pissing off pelosi by speaking out against a bill that has near unanimous consent?
my man, do you hear yourself? bernie voted FOR and DEFENDED the cares act on the senate floor because of the $600 weekly ui payments. you‚Äôre attacking aoc cus u think she voted for that and is lying while defending bernie who very openly did?
why would she lie about taking a deeply unpopular position that even bernie didn‚Äôt take, the cares act is super popular. i am critical of its wealth transfer to corps, but most people do not even care and the 600$ a week in ui was lifesaving. no benefit to speaking out against it
funniest part abt horny online clout sharks is their insane ego. like yeah aoc actually knew this bill would turn into the cares act, advocated against it, said she voted against it afterwards, but secretly voted for it. why? cus she wanted to win over the assange twitter cranks
love this man. it really shows how brain dead you are. i hope you know that. this isn‚Äôt the same bill. it‚Äôs something entire different that the senate gutted and turned into cares act. she voted for that back in july 2019 before covid. this shows exactly why you‚Äôre a tulsi simp

oh i didn‚Äôt know the massive corporate stimulus covid recovery bill (cares act) was voted on NEARLY A YEAR BEFORE WE KNEW COVID EXISTED. brilliant insight.
bro people in my audience are so fucking weird sometimes. what is even going on ?!    
oh no.
why are there so many people who just flat out claim that aoc voted for the cares act? it‚Äôs very weird. do people know something i don‚Äôt?
Cuellar got his start in Congress by getting GOP allies in the state legislature to carve out a district for him in the infamous Delay map, one of the most notorious cases of partisan gerrymandering in recent memory. Cuellar then primaried the then-head of the Hispanic caucus.

at first i thought republicans are just straight evil for not passing a stimulus despite it's clear benefits to the economy as well as immediate relief that people that need. now ik they are also stupid along with evil because they didn't realize what would happen to the economy

deeply disturbing that most of the symbolic victories for half the country is to get the loudest minority to come to terms w/ things like  wearing a mask is good to slow viral spread -  or  the person who won more votes in the electoral college becomes the next president 
There will always be intense leftist infighting if we assume our allies  lost their way  instead of  disagree with me strategically . I'm much more inclined to assume the latter in the majority of cases. If we all do that we have empathy  amp; understanding instead of burning bridges
yo we literally treat republicans like they‚Äôre babies, celebrating every tiny thing they do no matter how many tantrums they threw along the way.

hillary clinton conceded the next day. trump still hasn't conceded. what is this comparison even?
everyone complaining about how the democrats also wanted to change the electoral college results fail to recognize that this isn't exactly a good defense. okay, so you know it was bad when they did it, why are you also doing it now ? also it was just op-eds lmao
.  is a platform built on gaming. But it‚Äôs home to more. Much more. 
And   is at the top of that revolution.
its a game that's absolutely getting carried by deep lore from the tabletop franchise. i was very overwhelmed by the menus as well, and now that I finished i'm still doing all the side quests. haven't been this addicted in a game in so long.
you and werewolf cock
this is a very thoughtful and well done video on my past couple of years on twitch by  . thank you for the recognition, here's to many years on the platform where i will inevitably defeat the nameless king.  
i slept in this morning. first time in a long time. back to regular content schedule today. going to review all the awards i won this week and i have a special surprise for everyone.
idk abt the meta critic thing but the rest is right. they also deliberately hid the buggy previous gen versions from  the reviewers and forced them not to show game footage
just finished that side mission it‚Äôs fun i def suggest it
i logged 38 hours in 3 days.
everything great about the game revolves around how well they built on this rich universe. the factions, gangs and side characters/quests are better than the main storyline.
thats that vampire style buggy ass gameplay right there
i feel a profound sense of sadness that cyberpunk is over. it was truly an incredible game that reminded me of my fav childhood rpgs. i feel bad that so many people without a solid pc won't be able to experience it in the same way. without the million different bugs its a 9.5/10

they don‚Äôt have power in the cultural arena either but corporations are risk averse, and will act when there‚Äôs enough criticism brewing. aesthetic and meaningless victories abound as we keep trying to sanitize cultural superstructure when the material base is fundamentally broken
excited for the biden admin to be exactly like obama‚Äôs last 4 years. very little material progress for marginalized ppl,  amp; thus, many of them organizing to ‚Äúclean up culture‚Äù as they recognize their powerlessness in the political arena and shift focus to places where they have it
no. i am enjoying the fuck out of the game that you‚Äôre considering to be transphobic. i also don‚Äôt think the game is transphobic. my response is worse than you think. i am literally ‚Äútechnically losing money‚Äù to play this ‚Äútransphobic‚Äù game because of how much i enjoy it.
i shouldn‚Äôt ever reply to shit like this esp because these are great orgs that you‚Äôve mentioned here. so i think we‚Äôre going to end this convo here respectfully before i start saying things that are hurtful as you desperately claw for a 15 seconds of internet brigading.
i‚Äôve helped raise money for both, will continue to do so - but the funny part is that you think im gaining subs while playing this game.

you sound kinna jealous man
i have streamed every. single. day. this past year averaging 10 hours a day. i usually cover politics for 5-6 hours of that no matter what. if i wanna play a fucking game for a couple days, you will shut the fuck up and go get your news kick somewhere else. suck my dick.
the internet is a wonderful, and i love my community but some of you are way to fucking familiar and need to be reminded of your place.  
dude honest fuck yourself. i'm not your fucking content pig.
having said that, i am playing on a fairly solid pc w a 2080ti. and i have definitely heard a lot of complaints about the console version having a boatload of issues. something to consider for the time being.
cyberpunk is exactly the kind of game i love. absolutely addicted. another 13 hours today and i can't wait to play more tomorrow.
among us absolutely deserved the award they just got for best multiplayer

i can‚Äôt wait to play cyberpunk, might start early again
zoomers that watch me are confused by these ancient texts as they were literally three when it happened
it‚Äôs so funny considering how controversial this inaccessible secret ‚Äúsex mini game‚Äù was at the time. it sparked a class action lawsuit, hillary clinton called that photo above ‚Äúpornographic‚Äù we are such puritanical luddites.  
as i go on a search for sex workers on today‚Äôs cyberpunk stream, we must pay respects to where we got here from. the gta hot coffee mod i downloaded when i was fourteen.  
it is an entirely different game and now that i played it offstream w the beefed up settings i am bummed.
ofc they have.
can‚Äôt wait for brain dead ppl to say this is sexist and ageist. liberals talked about the 25th amendment for trump all year. Diane Feinstein is occupying a seat that should be taken by a much more progressive democrat.  
testing cyberpunk at max settings offstream and it runs pretty well. impossible to stream like this on a single pc setup unfortunately. it also kind of looks like a different game.
vampire is in my top 5 all time favs
i already bought this game on steam but i'm afraid my saves from gog won't transfer if i download it off that launcher again right?
the funniest bug so far has been me switching from the early release game to get the launch patch which triggered a full dl it's entirety - and subsequently lost me access to the game altogether. now it's asking for a new license to play it. hopefully my saves synced.  
There are literally Israeli-only highways in the West Bank.  
cyberpunk is buggy but awesome. i can‚Äôt believe a world so vast and dense is explorable. the story has been great so far as well.
I AM OFFICIALLY A GAMING STREAMER!!!! 11 HOURS OF STRAIGHT CYPERPUNK!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR ROUND TWO TOMORROW! AND THERE WAS LIKE 18K PEOPLE HERE ALL DAY WATCHING TOO.

This is why I do not want more aggressive moderation on YouTube. Time and time again I‚Äôve seen it used to silence all the wrong people. Anti-fascists get banned for talking about N*zis. Feminists banned for talking about r*pe. LGBT+ for talking about their existence.  
this is the saddest someones ever been sitting infront of a computer at 7am. I woke up in a frenzy w like 4 hours of sleep. saw the message, didn't realize it was just a day one code. idk why they sent me a day 1 code i already bought the game myself :(
OMG I THINK IT WAS JUST A DAY ONE CODE NOT EARLY ACCESS I HATE MYSELF
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING I DELETED MY OWN PERSONAL PURCHASE FROM STEAM REDOWNLOADED WITH THE EARLY ACCESS CODE FROM GOG AND ITS NOT WORKING!  
once again, i am asking youtube to please have human beings check their videos.

i have ryzen 9 3900X 3.8 GHz 12 Core and a 2080ti. I don't have a two pc stream setup. ik it will run cyberpunk well on it's own but will it STREAM well? should I get a new prebuilt? don't tell me to build it, i refuse.
insanely excited for the vaccine üíâ i would take it even if it put a nanochip in me if it means being able to kiss people at bars once every 3 months again.
i do love reactionaries, but i think all these other platforms turn into nazi hives when they don‚Äôt do enough moderation
when conservatives say the right is being silenced, i think they mean the left *exists* on their platform
the price is a flex. it‚Äôs a part of the branding.
nothing is longer or more rewarding than the 10 extra mins of sleep you get after hitting snooze

AND THE CYBERPUNK REVIEWS ROLL IN  
it‚Äôs honestly wild that they wouldn‚Äôt focus more on something that would greatly improve time spent on their platform. marginal improvements would go an insanely long way.
this also happens i thought it was due to my apple tv
let‚Äôs say you fall asleep watching a show and it plays the whole episode. when you get back on, and you‚Äôre one episode ahead, you have to literally search the show, press add details and then find the episode you left it on. no other way to quickly access all episodes of the show
actually, now that i think about it almost all the streaming platforms (except for netflix) have pretty subpar to awful user interfaces. why is that?
having said that, i am enjoying ‚Äúthe flight attendant‚Äù
hbomax has the worst ui out of every streaming platform. hands down. what a mess.

i've literally never seen someone as painfully unlikeable as kelly loefler no wonder she had to buy that seat. the republican party actually fucked up by appointing her over anyone else. i wasn't hopeful before, but warnock might actually win.
bro kelly loeffler is like if you gave an ai talking points to read. just completely emotionless. how will georgians vote for this sociopath
watching reverend warnock destroy kelly loeffler in the georgia senate runoff debate

I am a master negotiator. I went to my boss to ask for a raise. They offered a 10% increase in my salary. I declined. A few weeks later I went back to negotiate and they offered a 10% salary decrease. I accepted. I named that masterful move ‚ÄúThe Pelosi‚Äù.
the party not in power has every incentive to keep obstructing in contemporary us politics where wedge issues solidly define party polarization.
-either you win both the house and senate 
-or change the loyalties w messaging and organizing year round like republicans do. 
americans think millionaire oil barons in tx are more working class than latina bartenders in ny, as they think black reverends from mlk‚Äôs church are less christian than trump. 
at some point we gotta stop letting republicans define these values and running along w their framing 
This is the person Donald Trump wants you to think is a Communist who hates America. Warnock is the minister at MLK‚Äôs former church. Conservatives in the 60s called MLK a ‚ÄúCommunist who hates America‚Äù too.  
this, and also same w calling it the trump vaccine. if it gets republicans to take it i‚Äôm on board.  
nvm we gotta return to tradition
at last nights rally there was another wild short video that made it seem like ossof wants to ‚Äúbeat republicans‚Äù and not electorally but physically. insanity. but not as insane as the antichrist donald trump using scripture from a sermon rev warnock delivered against him. wild.
quite remarkable that so many georgians will end up voting for loefler and perdue, two out of touch corrupt rich assholes who placed their own interests over the interests of georgians, mired in insider trading scandals.
we nearly agree on everything on this list noah youre sounding a bit radical
i actually believe this.
dan crenshaw is the son of an oilman. he went to tufts  amp; joined the navy rotc to become an officer. he got a masters from harvard after touring. of course he‚Äôs not going to understand his fellow vets who enlisted right out of hs who needed stability  amp; upwards social mobility.
communist.
the outfits are so wild, everyone‚Äôs so happy. little do they know some of these celebrities will have their last moment in the spotlight that night. it‚Äôs also fun to see superstars in the 90s and 00s when they were just starting off. idk why i love this acc.
do you ever look at an old photo  amp; feel nostalgia even tho it‚Äôs not your experience but it feels like it is? that‚Äôs how i feel about the nightopenings ig acc. it‚Äôs an entire concept (red carpets) that‚Äôs now dead. i‚Äôve attended some back in the day, but i love looking at old ones
snl sundays is back baby !
That‚Äôs why   and I are calling for giving $2,000/month to Americans until this pandemic ends.  
a mecha anime
Funny how Trump and DeVos have paused these payments for months and it's never called a Brahmin bailout, or said that they ignore the struggles of the non-college educated  
my guy this is still incredibly well done. i‚Äôve never been able wrap anything
yep
holy shit trump supporters never fail to outdo themselves as being such pathetic morons. good job. honestly remarkable.
Interesting propaganda at the Trump rally; it splices Ossoff euphemistically saying  you're going to get beaten so bad you can never run or show your face in public  with footage of protesters getting into fights. Echoes NRSC video from last month.

trump   if i lost, i'd be a very gracious loser. 
for being such a narcissist, it's wild how much trump is willing to debase himself for a party that very clearly used him and tossed him to the side like a cum rag when he had outlived his usefulness.
trump claims warnock and ossof are the most radical leftist candidates in the history of the us. and the dems want something more than socialism, they want a communistic government.
TRUMP RALLY IN GEORGIA IS NOW LIVE FOLKS, SO MUCH COPIUM WE MIGHT OVERDOSE.  
POBOX TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
The filing fee alone was $402 and   is doing this entirely pro bono. 
Pls chip in to to our FOIA war chest (complete with amusing/enraging FOIA war stories!) so we can afford to keep doing this 
the Anglo-ization of America. go fight in an imperial war that we‚Äôre going to have forever, achieve no heroism, enrich some viceroy, and finally kill someone so you can hold it over people‚Äôs heads over the course of your lifetime of enjoying nothing  
it's like my man went to afghanistan so he could cry about it for the rest of his life. what about the vets who now work in the service industry you fucking asshole?  
DAYCARE IS NOW OPEN! GET IN WHILE THE CONTENT IS HOT. TURNS OUT DAN CRENSHAW HATES THE WORKING CLASS. WOW I AM SO SHOCKED!!!! WOWOW. JOIN NOW!!!  
anti trans people are the weirdest fucking people on the planet, whatre you going to do? check everyone's private parts in the bathrooms? anyway, here's ben shabibo losing his mind at elliot page being trans.  
republican voter suppression initiatives have always been justified by the countless hours professional republicans spend casting doubt on the integrity of our elections. this was simply a logical extension of that rhetoric. maybe we should stop acting like they‚Äôre honest.  
republicans love talking about how they left the democratic party but then yell at lin wood about how he‚Äôs still a secret DEMONrat because of his past donations! he‚Äôs a red blooded trump lovin god fearing american who wants gop to know the consequences of not defending trump!
no dude everyone knows if you‚Äôre a unionized worker benefiting from greater profit sharing like an athlete does, then you‚Äôre no longer a worker. or when you‚Äôre an adjunct professor making 7$ an hour. still not a worker. only republicans are workers!
wow this republican dude is spitting fire üî• ngl time to set aside our differences as bernie bros!  
11,000 workers at Tyson Foods got COVID  amp; 36 died while managers made bets on how many would get sick. The working conditions were so bad they ‚Äúshook‚Äù a local sheriff ‚Äúto his core.‚Äù No, I will not vote to give corporations a license to harm workers. We must hold them accountable.
noah political extremism is entirely subjective- perhaps the reason people get upset about horseshoe theory is because it neatly presupposes us third way neoliberalism as the center when bernies proposals for the most part read like modest social democratic reforms outside the us
lotsa kids named tonibler in kosovo tho
babenbruh
who is this  
this is actually a good promoted tweet tho
conor lamb spent all last month whining to every media outlet he could find that dems need to support policy that polls well and then went ahead and voted against marijuana legalization which is supported by 70% of americans
they turned the one weakness vampires are supposed to have (sunlight) into the most campy thing ever, glitter.

every waking moment i have not on stream is dedicated to news programs, podcasts, audiobooks. then i can‚Äôt listen music on stream because of dmcas. when would i even have time?
this is the type of shirt you find at a thrift store 10 years from now and it‚Äôs a gem.
i don‚Äôt listen to music. at all. even when i‚Äôm working out. chat made me feel weird about this yesterday.
i use a pressure point roller it‚Äôs very good
Benny boy is just a bit obsessed  
i‚Äôm 29 you freak.

slept with a air purifier (champagne socialist wants to purify air, ik) and it feels like i slept well for the first time in months. could be a placebo. but i had like actual uninterrupted wakeup drooling sleep. on separate note i messed up my back again lifting yesterday.
One group of people i feel really sorry for this year is the folks who like to make wine and beer out of their pussy juices and spit. Can't have your boys over to try the special batch of Mouthscrape Mead because fuckin GARCETTI says the den is too small. Bum deal
suck my dick.
if there‚Äôs a potential voter out there, trump will do anything he can to turn them out. this is why they performed above expectations.  
all travel is prohibited, except the outdoor gyms are open. what am i gonna do? teleport?  
Damn, Mr. President.
Didn‚Äôt you say ‚ÄúTrayvon could‚Äôve been my son?‚Äù 
In 2014, #BlackLivesMatter was too much.
In 2016, Kaepernick was too much.
Today, discussing police budgets is too much.
The problem is America's comfort with Black death -- not discomfort with slogans.   
finished demon souls. it's the easiest in the soulsborne franchise with sekiro being the hardest w no opportunities to cheese, overlevel, summon or create op builds. still a great game to pay respects to esp as it led to such an incredible franchise.  
incredible experience!!!  
this was a lot longer than the one i heard before üò±  
talking to   of the   on joe biden's cabinet picks. join now  
lee this is a horrible argument that you can only believe if you think the service that police have historically provided is similar to educators (for an overall good) or molestation was what teachers were trained to do as a part of their job w/ very little legal repercussions
watching the 46 minute speech trump put out about how he didn't lose. this man is a machine.  
DAYCARE IS OPEN. I AM TALKING ABOUT MESSAGING AROUND DEFUND THE POLICE, AND OBAMA'S PRESS TOUR AROUND IT. GET IN NOW. THERE'S STEPHEN CROWDER REVIEW AS WELL. POGGARS.  
lmao
hutch. maybe, just maybe. ‚Äúthe message works‚Äù because they say it w their fucking chest from their think tanks to their legislators instead of whining like little babies about what demands activists are making, therefore making their argument more palatable, and mainstream.
if you consider this to be an effective strategy you need to check your own biases. defund the police is a slogan, it‚Äôs what you make it. i just slapped on corporate capitalist language around the actual goals to appeal to ppl making 250k a year in dc and you‚Äôre gushing over it.
anyway dems don‚Äôt wanna do any of this anyway they just wanna use the left and activists as a reason for their inevitable failure in ga.
my point is simple, we all know what the message is. it‚Äôs grassroots culvitated. dems cant control it, only direct it. so say, okay we see you, we hear you- we‚Äôre going to communicate what ‚Äúdefund‚Äù actually means. same thing happened w blm
gop activism is largely astroturfed so their messaging is manicured out the gates (pro life), but the real republican message is dems are baby killers. do you think national republicans tell alabama to dial it back w their insane rollbacks? no. because they rely on the division.
we focus tested this message with 500 people w marketing degrees living in washington dc and it seems to be doing a lot better than ‚Äúdefund the police!‚Äù ew!!!!!!!!!!!!!
in order to win neoliberals you have to use their language! try saying  ‚Äúwe need to eliminate redundancies in the police force and better distribute newly freed capital into growth sectors like social work. it‚Äôs clear that increasing investments in police has diminishing returns‚Äù
What if activists aren‚Äôt PR firms for politicians  amp; their demands are bc police budgets are exploding, community resources are shrinking to bankroll it,  amp; ppl brought this up for ages but it wasn‚Äôt until they said ‚Äúdefund‚Äù that comfortable people started paying attn to brutality
this is the best explanation I've seen for   defund the police   as a slogan and policy
lupe fiasco is an actual samurai
Imagine thinking that‚Äôs a good system  
PETA is COINTELPRO designed to make animal welfare/rights seem freakish and idiotic. fix my internet so I can do my taxes and then game or I‚Äôll keep revealing truths
twitch is broken but i'm still covering obama defending drone strikes on the late show w/ stephen colbert  
I AM LIVE. ELLIOT PAGE HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS TRANS, 1 TRILLION DOLLAR STIMULUS PACKAGE IS BEING WORKED ON. NEWS IS HAPPENING ALL AROUND US. YALLA LES GO. GET IN NOW.  
i posted before on my ig story taunting it w very little health left. but it was one hit and i  accidentally  clapped it. and by accident, i mean i caved and killed it.
it brings me no pleasure to inform you that i accidentally clapped maneater offstream.
last night i finished the last kingdom and immediately started rewatching vikings. shouts out to ac valhalla for getting me into all this, i kinna dropped the game for the show but you know it‚Äôs been wonderful constantly googling shit about saxons and danes.
one of my stream savers dropped me an insane late game katana +5 and i one tapped an invader mage looking for a good time on 2-1 it was excellent
did you do the luck glitch?
miyazaki deserves jailtime for 4-2 map design and maneater.
old kyle tweets grew on me  
the year a conservative editor gave my slot to charlie kirk cus the list was too liberal otherwise is my fav year.
told you.  
i do not sleep for long hours
what‚Äôs the argument for these fucking assholes like ‚Äúoh no please, come sig heil in between shifts as you manage the restaurant‚Äù just don‚Äôt be a fucking nazi man.
the most predictable gnome on the planet. why do you care?  
now in 2020, we have overcome the need for sex.
it‚Äôs a testament to how stupid that level is when you immediately know exactly where this
since jordan peterson was trending the other day i looked at his greatest hits  
the bosses themselves are easier than the other games. but the camera boss paired up w the narrow cliffside boss is way too op. half the battles feel like rng
yes
demon souls is the stupidest fucking game in the entire franchise and any souldborne fan who thinks it's good is just a delusional masochist mistaking absolutely horrible game design for a challenging experience. go ahead, tell me i'm wrong and it's actually bad on purpose.
new ideology just dropped  
DAYCARE IS OPEN! SOME BAD NEWS SOME GOOD NEWS, BUT ALL NEWS. STARTING NOW. GET IN FOR YOUR FRESH HOT CUP OF JOE NEWS.  
center for american liberalism  
it‚Äôs like claiming you put kamala harris on the ticket for black women, but then you make rahm emanuel transportation secretary. it‚Äôs kind of obv that you‚Äôre pandering and not even trying that hard.
i refuse to believe a single person cares about the ‚Äúall female comms team‚Äù sincerely, and are simply acting out roles that are expected of them. liberals will claim this is progress, reactionaries will cry and ask why there aren‚Äôt men- but no real human being cares abt this shit
Fun fact  Since 2009 when he joined, Donald Trump has tweeted 58,700 times. Since 2010 when she joined, Neera Tanden has tweeted 87,500 times.
can‚Äôt wait to push this admin left w my posts :)
a lot of ppl tagged me idk what it is but id be down
i have a herman miller aeron. it‚Äôs super expensive but pretty good. takes a bit of time getting used to it but once you do it‚Äôs great. you can prolly find one second hand
Oh darn! If only there were some warning signs like Joe Biden‚Äôs explicitly stated politics and decades of history believing all the same things as Rahm Emmanuel! Oh well  
FOLKS, ITS REDEMPTION TIME. I AM LOOKING AT BAN APPEALS. YALLA LESGO!!!!  
Get well soon!  
before the cancel brigade comes in with weaponized misogyny accusations, ass sucking is not gender specific.
neera tanden sucks ass. that is all.
DAYCARE IS OPEN!!!! WE ARE WATCHING TRUMPS FIRST TV INTERVIEW SINCE HE GOT OWNED. TALKING ABOUT THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR SCIENTIST THAT GOT ASSASSINATED AND THEN WE'LL DO SUNDAY FUNDAY STUFF.  
when you say shit like  republicans are the working class party  all you're revealing abt yourself is that you think the us working class responds better to coded white supremacist attitudes embedded in our culture than shallow representative idpol that's over-corrective.
ultimately neither parties policies are truly geared towards the working class. one party at least offers lip service towards it in their advocacy like increasing the minimum wage, while the gop builds a network of disinformation to counter that and focuses on cultural grievances
you can look at the wealthiest counties flipping blue, or the number of billionaires that vote democrat to make stupid arguments, but that's because of the fealty both parties have towards the rich and their interests. they're not threatened by dems  
it's mind boggling how so many politics understanders on here act like this isn't the case. republican party using reactionary cultural grievance points to win over disaffected rural white voters has been consistent w/ the loss of labor power. dems still win the working class tho  
anyone else have an elgato and goxlr in their ps5 stream setup ? Idk why i keep having issues with the audio (crackling, massive delay) whenever i turn on my ps5 which often requires another full shutdown to fix the problem. also cant direct sound to my goxlr, i double from obs
This made my night/day/week/month/year/lifetime üò≠üíñ‚ô•Ô∏è    
trump gave his first tv interview to walmart judge jeanine, maria bartiromo - we shall see if he's still got it or not. probably not tho.
i ate wayyyy too much cookie butter and still awake at 2 30am. i am a child.
refuse to believe they called something bebbanburg
this looks like san bongino before he cycled
what‚Äôs this?  
listen i am fascinated by conservatives, they are incredibly entertaining. but using idpol as a shield for someone very clearly doing white supremacist agitative propaganda makes you look like a simp.
you hate to see it.  
POBOX TIME  
Thank you  !
It was awesome chatting with you about how we can build a better world.
In Canada, things aren't perfect and we face many of the same challenges.
But, together we can do better.

holy shit i am a boomer now. i absolutely agree with this obv boomerbait.  
hitchcock took a weird direction w this one

profits and ratings are all they care about so use that to your advantage
the next leftist candidate must give the media ratings - this kind of earned media is demonstrably more successful than ad buys.

why don‚Äôt you live in la then?
i miss autumn in nj, perhaps the only time when nj seems pretty
the worst thing you can do is not pay people to stay inside, not use existing state/military functions to keep people safe and cared for in lockdown, etc. but right after that is openly telling people ‚Äúfuck you, I‚Äôm not doing this dumb shit but you have to.‚Äù
shmokin doinks, bannin subs  
‚Äújust vote for the democrats üôÇ‚Äù  
i said dope canadians not lame ones
not lebron too
get your racist uncle in the discord i will talk to them
why is this a gif  
the california government purchased these homes for a freeway extension. the project was nixed 2 years ago. 65 homes owned by the state remain vacant since then. now those wish to make use of these vacant unused houses are being violently removed. shelter is a human right.  
this thanksgiving i don‚Äôt think you should hold your racist relatives accountable, they‚Äôre too far gone for that. just have fun with it. freestyle, make shit up about how you heard mitch mcconnell eats baby spinal fluid and that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt do a second stimulus to hurt trump
they keep telling me it‚Äôs cus i need to git gut
can‚Äôt wait! we‚Äôre going to have some special guests as well. friday 4pm pacific i‚Äôm gonna be playing among us w some dope canadians!

bear_fucker
only a sisterfucking inbred donkey could believe such a racist claim. get your hapsburg jawed ass out of my fucking mentions.
wondering about a lot of things this morning at the gym.  
hmm i wonder if not offering national help to your freshman muslim congresswoman and instead launching accusations from the center along w right wingers as trump made her a racist target while biden focused on switch ticket voters had something to do w it. on top of the weed guy.  
it‚Äôs a time honored republican tradition to shit on social safety nets while gobbling them up
can you imagine republican latino outreach in texas crying about how latinos want social safety nets? no they don‚Äôt give a fuck, they hammer the religion shit as hard as they can because they know older latinos tend to be more socially conservative. because they want to win.
hmm i wonder what other characteristic these hispanic voters have that makes them SUPER unique? you will never hear the establishment dems talk about this - but it‚Äôs their support for big govt social safety nets. how bout instead of crying about religion we focus on that?  
in this latest idiotic video, steven crowder (a creative arts major) tries to act like the humanities are stupid and everyone should only pursue stem. he also kind of makes an argument for free college.  
This by  .  
yes, everyone you caught me. i fake my voice on my ig stories. it's not just hoarse in the mornings because i'm an old man who yells 12 hours a day professionally. its the other thing.
what‚Äôs the best mutual aid network or nonprofit for food insecurity in los angeles?
can‚Äôt stop thinking about spoooderman very excited to play later great stream game
he‚Äôs just like   sickos who helped me be more sick w their words in book form.
jordan peterson comes from a long line of sickos who go out and write self help books to exploit vulnerable people in need of guidance when they fit that category perfectly
its hilarious that these idw types branded themselves as free speech defenders, especially that clown ben shapiro who once wanted to charge al gore with sedition for speaking at the jiddah economic forum. ben also ofc is a supporter of the canary mission  
‚ÄúIf you have your children in a school, and [teachers] talk about equity in class--equity, diversity, white privilege, systemic racism, any of that--you take your children out of that class‚Äù

finally watching the new dave chappelle
TRUMP IS LIVE AND PARDONING A TURKEY!  
Weird how   gets cut off here midway through discussing the details of  ‚Äôs disastrous record  
want to point out that taking ownership of emergency relief you categorically opposed is textbook republican!
i love hearing about how bolsonaro has killed 169k but his popularity has increased due to his billions in emergency spending to the poor. a republican you should thank for making trump a 1 term president isn‚Äôt in the lincoln project, but mitch mcconnell.
it‚Äôs ofc, notoriously free to make an f35. don‚Äôt you call yourself a libertarian?  
it‚Äôs not an inability if it‚Äôs weaponized
hmmm ü§î  
wouldn‚Äôt wanna leave my apt anywhere else
Not that a member of Congress needs defending but Tlaib has had an extremely public fight with Pompeo and Israel (which banned her) over this very subject, this is wildly disingenuous    
this was a year ago when i‚Äôd barely get 2k people watching me play games. we‚Äôve come a long way and i‚Äôm really happy w how much the community has grown üòå    
Melania's excited  It's Christmas time at the White House again.  
i guess its a concession?  
What is so hard to understand about this?
Rahm Emanuel helped cover up the murder of Laquan McDonald. Covering up a murder is disqualifying for public leadership.
This is not about the ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù of a post. It is shameful and concerning that he is even being considered.   
votepig cuck. real trump supporters show their loyalty by engaging in the collective action of not voting until the republicans make trump president!  
DAYCARE IS NOW OPEN. ITS MONDAY AND WE'RE MOURNING THE LOSS OF SIDNEY POWELL, A BRAVE TRUTHTELLER WHO GOT FIRED BY THE TRUMP CAMP LAST NIGHT, BECAUSE TRUMP MUST BE WORKING WITH CHAVEZ AND CASTRO. AND OFC MORE NEWS.  
thought, maybe if i use ‚Äúliberal twitter voice‚Äù it‚Äôll hit different
stop. normalizing. the. republican. party.  
media is so horny for any republican figure to just say normal things like ‚Äúafter numerous recounts and 30+ lawsuits being dismissed, donald trump should concede‚Äù just so they can keep operating under the false pretense that this is a normal system w some differences in opinion
i am not trending. it‚Äôs the better hasan who‚Äôs trending.
absolutely wild week lined up.
the last kingdom is awesome. so was barbaren. really into this rn.
i feel bad everytime i rage quit the stream. probably good to take a short day. hanging out w will and murat.
going to be a long 4 years  
charlie it has 138k likes to 4.6k dislikes. i don‚Äôt think ppl are aware of or even watching this if they‚Äôre not fans of trump to begin with
THIS DERANGED SIDNEY POWELL INTERVIEW W/ NEWSMAX HAS 2.3M VIEWS IN ONE DAY ON YOUTUBE. ITS NOT JUST FB WHERE BOOMERS GET THEIR MISINFO  
DAYCARE IS OPEN AND ITS SUNDAY FUNDAY WHICH MEANS ITS MANDATORY FUN TIME GET IN NOW.

damn a domestic terrorist kills two people and suddenly white people want prison reform
Literally all Tucker Carlson did was ask for someone to show him evidence of voter fraud and now he's being accused of raping children by other trumpers. The Trump cult rules

david would you like to explain some of this to my 20 year old audience and also me as well
seems it‚Äôs gonna take a bit longer than that
there‚Äôs nothing funnier than thinking if there were creatures technologically advanced enough to come to our galaxy, they‚Äôd choose a fucking cornfield in iowa to land at. even politicians only act like they care about iowa once every 4 years.
the danes did nothing wrong to uthred
the last kingdom is very good
Rahm Emanuel covered up the murder of a Black teenager, Laquan McDonald, while he was Mayor of Chicago. 
That he's being considered for a cabinet position is completely outrageous and, honestly, very hurtful.
nah she‚Äôs too thick for clen i just wanted to add something on there
call of duty ‚Äúbad ending‚Äù literally makes more sense than ‚Äúgood ending‚Äù - no spoilers but the devs seem kinna went wild w this one.
Here's what an ER doc told me about Thanksgiving when I asked yesterday   
TIME TO ARM SOME VIOLENT PARAMILITARIES AGAINST DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENTS, BUT THEN BLAME IT ON THE USSR - ITS COLD WAR TIME BAYYYBEEE  
picked up this bad boy  
trump wants to fuck his daughter and you worship him, yet you continue to spread racist lies about ilhan omar.
its literally legal to marry your first cousin in the state of georgia you inbred, racist, clenbuterol-taking, qanon believing crossfit sicko.  
Ottoman  gt; Byzantine Empire
Not reading the replies on this 
right now, racist inbred donkey's like marjorie have to keep their incest behind closed doors. this displeases them.
marjorie taylor greene only wishes this awful racist lie was true, so she could comfortably get fucked by her immediate family.  
DAYCARE IS OPEN! WE ARE LIVE FOLKS. TRUMP GAVE A HEALTHCARE PRESSER AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT AND ALSO FUN STUFF LIKE AMERICAN WAR CRIMES DURING THE COLD WAR EARLY! GET IN NOW.  
going to be live at 12pm pacific!

why does that fit so well wtf
every time i see a new video of a dog on my timeline, i‚Äôm one step closer to adopting a new pupper
they look good as hell tho, what‚Äôs in the white one
is this one instance where the cop fucked the wife rather than the other way around ?
is he this wide or is it the lense ?
i see you liking this tweet   please come on the broadcast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dave chappelle is on joe rogan!
biden says there won't be a national shutdown under any circumstance. i get what he's trying to say, except if our spread keeps going we will functionally have to do a national shutdown, maybe enforced at every state at the state level.
UPDATE  For those of you who missed it, Hasan's daycare will open at 12 30 PM Pacific today! Hasan has a secret project going on today, so stream will start a bit late! See you all soon!
i‚Äôm doing a super secret special project for a friend so i‚Äôll be live at 12 30pm pacific sorry for the delay
traditional conservative family values  
Also on  ‚Äôs stream I reported that officials were expecting this right around 3 am and it would be a big boost to Biden. Trump should spend more time watching Hasan‚Äôs stream and less time on OANN and maybe he could save himself these embarrassments  
did every tiktok star move to la and cycle anavar, or did they collectively hit puberty ?

i‚Äôm sure the president constantly lying about the election results to his millions of stans won‚Äôt have long term complications
Essential workers risk their lives to do the labor that increases the already obscene wealth of corporations like Amazon  amp; Walmart. While these corps make BILLIONS they have yet to offer their workers hazard pay. Report by  ,  ,    
you better stop talking shit about black pink tho üò°  
i think your horseface is pleasant to look at
valhalla?
i‚Äôm watching the last kingdom and it‚Äôs awesome btw, high key recommend
omg

just some regular old republican diversity of ideas  
DAYCARE IS OPEN! BUT WE'RE FOLLOWING COVID RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE ITS RAVAGING THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES EVEN THO THE HOGS DON'T WANNA ACKNOWLEDGE IT WHICH IS WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT! COME NOW.  
here's the youtube video that goes along with this tweet.  
i drive a v6 w heated leather seats baby !
i still do not understand why my logitech g pro wireless mouse randomly double clicks both on the scroll wheel and also on the left click. not good.
yes, this is what i look like.
watching the obama 60 mins interview with the biggest obama simp,    
There is no society that can survive without strong men. The East knows this. In the west, the steady feminization of our men at the same time that Marxism is being taught to our children is not a coincidence. 
It is an outright attack. 
Bring back manly men.   
i‚Äôm a liberal who wants the restore the soul of the nation
kamala harris and joe biden are live and talking about the economy.  
DAYCARE IS OPEN!!! ITS THE MOST MASCULINE DAYCARE. JK THAT SHIT IS SO LAME! ONLY INSECURE NERDS GET BENT AT DUDES WEARING DRESSES LMAO  
ben you're 5'3, can't grow facial hair and weigh 100lbs soaking wet. if we can both be considered men, you should probably be a bit more open minded about gender expressions. it's clearly not as rigid a binary as you try to imply it is.  
you might've thought i was italian, or irish - meanwhile i was  a dane all along
I have to come clean - feel like i'm leading a double life off stream. 
on stream i'm playing demon souls and no valhalla - off stream i'm playing valhalla and started watching the last kingdom and it's actually good. 
and then vegans try and eat them smh  
everyone has a better setup than me lol
LMAO THIS DUDES FIT WAS BANNED IN TURKEY IN 1925
HASAN-  
can confirm. but also it‚Äôs cus i‚Äôve transcended beyond the need to pursue the carnal pleasures.  
DAYCARE IS NOW OPEN AND ITS SUNDAY FUNDAY WHICH MEANS MANDATORY FUN OR ELSE YOU GO TO JAIL. CHECKING IN ON THE DC HOGWATCH AND THEN DOING GAMING! LETS GO  
respect !
i‚Äôm so used to seeing wet and horrible food on my tl that this confused me at first like it was wrong for food to look good.
a very cute one too!
i‚Äôm in print. pretty wild. i need to find out where i can buy a newspaper  
He can also do a pretty good Irish accent, I‚Äôve learned.    
how dare you!!!!! wolf among us was so much fun
in america you absolute brain dead imbecile. it killed 260k in the united states of america. this year. the flu range is 30-70k. goddamnit trump supporters are such donkeys.
One thing I‚Äôve learned as a journalist is that basically every time a clip goes viral amongst the right wing of a right winger getting beat up by counter protesters, there‚Äôs always a second video showing the right winger started it.  
it‚Äôs especially funny because we now demonstrably know trump could‚Äôve won if he hadn‚Äôt completely fumbled the covid prevention/recovery. at a time when people were starting to forget about covid - he literally personally got it! a month out from election! cmon!!!!!!!
lmao this is before the peak of a massively fucked pandemic which killed 260k americans so far. are you saying that, accounting for trumps performance even w covid, that he wouldn‚Äôt have defeated biden ease without a biblical plague event?  
our hurt won't go away w joe biden. i'm afraid we are a fundamentally broken country. a dying empire.  
i wish i had backseaters.
REACTING TO THE  MILLION   MAGA MARCH   HOWG WATCH IS ALREADY LIVE!!!!
this is fr gonna happen tho  
  congrats tho !
  wish i knew what this felt like üò©üò©
same i need to talk to her as well
Million MAGA March in D.C. earlier today  
IM BACK AND I'M LIVE SO LETS GET BACK INTO SOME MORE MAGACOPIUM AND THEN ITS GAMER TIME.  
i just found out that I will be on at 3 30pm pacific on the weekly - at  . sit back and enjoy glitchcon until then everyone. i'm ofc going live after my appearance there at 4pm pacific.
Ok, this might be the best one yet.  
DAYCARE IS OPEN AND THERES SO MUCH COPIUM WE WILL EXTRACT FROM THE EARTH LIKE ITS A SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRY READY FOR SOME CIA DEMOCRACY. I AM OFC REFERRING TO HOGWATCH 2020. GET IN WHILE ITS HOT. THE COPE IS REAL!!!!  
okay that would actually be great tho. a jobs program to build union made radios in us factories to distribute all over and in turn fund our culture programs / subsidize more npr style broadcasting- beef up local media.
if you‚Äôre critical of capitalism you are not allowed to have a new am radio. you must only purchase old am radio.
yes, andray is famously a big fan of the bush admin, but only hates the women in it.
incredibly sexist of you to point this out !
a lot going on today. 
-monitoring some of the maga marchers over at dc for the million hog march
-glitchcon appearance at 2pm pacific
-more demon souls later. also cod zombies w/ poke after ?
insanely excited sitting at my desk waiting to go live!!!! 
this is literally the meme. she did the meme.    
what's a good mechanical keyboard that i can purchase that has larger keys- or is spaced out better (no numpad or Fn Keys) is this a problem that anyone else has? I feel like my hands are too big for regular keyboards.
i owned one of these in turkey when i was like 14, it was in doodoo brown. dunno how i ever recovered.
¬ª   breaks down the dirty little secret that keeps hurting Democrats' political campaigns  
the first thumb guy is one of the best divorced dad takedowns  i‚Äôve ever seen in my life  
demon souls is so good.
Something extremely bogus is going on. During the pandemic, Elon Musk became $78.5 billion richer while forcing his workers to take a 10% pay cut and firing employees after promising them they could take unpaid time off. Oligarchs gotta oligarch.    
those are great sub alerts
HEY VILLAINS! 
I'm hosting Glitch Con's Artist Ally segment tomorrow November 14! Come Support me and some of the Amazing artists that call #twitch their homes! #GlitchCon2020 10 20 AM PST. Be there and stay dangerous!   
i made it onto the bus, it's just as good as being there!  
why?????
i‚Äôm not the engineer of the family  
the closest we got to a concession is when trump said THIS admin will not go into a lockdown. which is insane, it's like he's trying to kill as many people as possible before he leaves office.
trump is now live. his hair looks like shit. he's claiming the covid vaccine development for himself while just last week he said it pfizer waited for the election to be over to announce the positive news.  
TRUMP IS ABOUT TO DELIVER HIS FIRST SPEECH SINCE THE DEFEAT LIVE GET IN NOW  
these people cry about AOC and socialism and then turn around and throw an event like this in the middle of the pandemic when 1,600 people died yest with 160k+ new covid cases a day. pathetic.  
DAYCARE IS OPEN ITS FRIDAY AND EVERYONE HAS COVID. ALSO DEVELOPING STORY IN MONTREAL  
so   SAYS he's a socialist but here he is hoarding all the hours, curious!  
i too like to picture myself as a hot guy in all my drawings
this is an insane amount of data. but very interesting to see that i was able to compete with media giants on streaming.  
finally defeating sekiro was one of my greatest gaming accomplishments, so very excited about FINISHING demon souls, a promise I made on stream during election night.
there are so many incredible new games coming out. assassins creed valhalla has been a lot of fun, definitely going to be playing the cold war campaign. when the ps5 arrives we have demon souls and spider man. the world is shitty otherwise but at least its gaming season
cus were both e-thots
it‚Äôs cus all i do is chat  
these pants are incredible
i have refreshed the delivery tracking page 1827374848x times since yesterday.
media company. as a matter one of their shows is literally called ‚Äúthe breakdown‚Äù ü§î
i still think ‚Äúthe police are republicans‚Äù is a good message, and one that republicans would use if the roles were reversed.
the whole narrative does not make any sense except as buck passing by a leadership clique that refuses to take responsibility for its own failures  
covid is certainly not going away and we haven‚Äôt hit the peak with holiday season yet. i no longer believe americans will take this seriously no matter who‚Äôs in charge.  
went to sleep at 10pm and woke up at 5am. this is the most i‚Äôve ever aligned with americans only voting block that matters. boomers.
murat and i are making my mom watch the chappelle show
ps5 got delayed till tomorrow :(

DAYCARE IS OPEN AND WERE COVERING THE NEWS. COVID RECORDS ARE BEING BROKEN!!! #1 BABY   
why do i feel like trump trying to pull out of afghanistan despite his loss is to make it easier for academi to completely privatize our operations there, as eric prince himself wrote about in nyt on aug 2017  
these people should sign a waiver deprioritizing themselves for hospital beds  
.  pranking Ric Grinnell makes it to    
i woke up at 5am and refreshed the tracking page w hopes that the package delivery time would have changed to be earlier in the day before going back to sleep
lying is technically legal so it‚Äôs okay when the president does it to make his brain dead hogs think the election is fake is not the brilliant takedown you thought it was!
once the results are certified most republicans will tell you it was trumps legal right to make these probes and now we‚Äôre safer knowing that the elections were legitimate. the issue is what they‚Äôre doing now leading up to that. it‚Äôs causing irreparable harm.
let me make something very clear. what trump is doing w lawsuits is technically legal, and the election results haven‚Äôt been certified yet. the issue is that it‚Äôs unprecedented,  amp; trump along w the gop are just lying and casting doubt on the results to brainwash their voters.
americans use more brain power trying to cope with why other countries are dealing w covid better than us, than actually dealing w covid.
australia was in a strict lockdown for months literally nothing was open except for grocery stores and the pharmacy, we had a 5km limit and an 8pm curfew and now we have 0 cases if you‚Äôre selfish and don‚Äôt care about people dying then just say that it‚Äôs easier  
Over 1500 people died yesterday from COVID-19. The number is going up, we must help working families through the worst of this pandemic. Pass #HEROESAct Now. 
‚òéÔ∏è Call your U.S. Senator now  866-832-1560

YOUTUBE IS DOWN SO ITS TIME TO PLAY VALHALLA  
Duped. Trying to be helpful to people who reach out on Veteran‚Äôs Day. 
It‚Äôs a shame people would do this on a day like today. 
DC is a sick city.     
DAYCARE IS OPEN AND IM NOW COVERING THE NEWS. LOTS GOING ON TODAY SO GET IN NOW  
listen, if you voted for jojo this isn‚Äôt about you. you‚Äôre still in the first toaster libertarian category. don‚Äôt worry.
Wow, shots fired from Hakeem Jeffries at Pelosi, the Queen of Meme herself  
mashallah
every few weeks there's a tweet on here that's like  normalize eating boogers, ya'll don't wanna have that conversation  and it gets like 66k rts which makes me happy that tumblr banned porn so all those folx could migrate over to this website
so many right libertarians went from ‚Äúseat belts are the nanny state‚Äù to ‚Äúthe president should weaponize his police state against those engage in freedom of movement. and also he should remain in power as long as he wants to.‚Äù
actually think this bad tweet is really helpful to illustrate part of the conservative mindset which is that political power (which they wield) will never be enough if they don‚Äôt also feel like the have cultural power (which they don‚Äôt really). again this is a bad tweet obviously  
COVIDICIDE BLIND SPEEDRUN ANY%  
sad!  
to be fair i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be a real coup, but it‚Äôs wild how much irreparable damage trump is continuing to cause by setting up the future groundwork for actual fascism to take root.
antifa has 1 casualty and the dude was executed by marshalls by directives from the president, meanwhile there are multiple white nationalist terrorists that have killed hundreds and people still try to make these out to be the same
this has always been the unequal balance for conservatives, even moderate ones. one side is doing a soft coup from a position of power, the other side had a celebrity say mean things. they are only comparable if you‚Äôre out of your mind or a huge baby.  
just wait man
wut
if you come to my stream right now, you will see something very different than politics. it's viking raid time    
.  on the NYT homepage right now     
yo   you trynna game?  
are they trying to manifest this into existence  the secret  style?  
thank you for this awesome write up  . I wouldn't be where I am without my community.  
dean dolezal  
republicans are going to pass a second relief bill with incredible provisions like  your employer is now legally allowed to murder you  with a much smaller amount of cash for the communities that desperately need it - and we're going to hear about bipartisanship for 4 years
joe biden said the classic democrat line   i'll take mcconnel at his word.  this is great.
is the republican plan meme-ing a coup into existence?
LISTENING TO KAMALA HARRIS AND JOE BIDEN ON PROTECTING THE ACA NOW  
yo chill you're giving my secrets away
what i didn't really understand until we had   on stream is how he built this amazing community of devoted people who sort of help him program his stream. seems like the secret is that his streams are basically a collab effort w/ his audience  
lmao this tweet is hilarious  
my mouth is full
this is incredible!!!!!!!!! will be reading this later on stream  
this is international collaboration i can get behind!
i think selling jets to every gulf nation on the condition that they look the other way when israel purges palestinians is probably not going to make the world a safer place in the long run
this country is so fundamentally broken. we‚Äôve had multiple italy‚Äôs at this point and a solid chunk of americans still do not want to even acknowledge the problem, let alone attempt the collective effort necessary to tackle this pandemic.  
RETURNING TO THIS LATER TODAY!!!!  
he deserves it! self care king
weird i thought it was only the naive, impractical left that was making this argument    
now it‚Äôs over folks  
Hello   one of your student organizers and top canvassers in NH just unseated an 18 year incumbent by running on a democratic socialist platform of affordable housing, universal childcare, and decarbonization  
i am definitely playing a bit of valhalla on my own atm but no main missions !
also medicare 4 all. like not even a joke. this is actually what they‚Äôre saying.
BRO HOW TF DID U GET ONE IN 23 MINS AND I HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ONE FOR A WEEK NOW
joe biden is president elect and i still can‚Äôt secure a ps5 preorder smh it really is like vuvuzellar out here
the no change is good cus we need bipartisanship
even tho you and i both now boomers dying won‚Äôt mean much in the way we vote
i think it‚Äôs better than guillotine memes
what happens when those people live in food deserts, do they simply die ?
this is perfectly rogan, sometimes profound- other times profoundly dumb.
fun reminder that joe rogan was right on covid before virtually everyone else and literally had osterholm on his show to warn us all despite the fact that he now goes full facebook karen when discussing covid.  
15-20% of americans actually vote on ideology, most are just partisan.
ben your side literally thinks the election was completely stolen, like not even foreign interference, that fellow americans just stole it outright. maybe you should stop fucking crying and work on preserving the integrity of our system you claim to care so much about.  
then the libs won‚Äôt take it !! (actually a bunch of antivax libs won‚Äôt take it regardless)
trying to get ppl to take joe biden‚Äôs vaccine, in a country were 70m voted for trump, and thinks the election was stolen from him is going to be incredible.
if you listen to republican politicians, you‚Äôd think americans were insanely anti immigration, want abortion to be illegal, and have no gun control whatsoever. this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. wish dems would fight half as hard as republicans do.
democrats love to talk about how unpopular progressive policies are when they aren‚Äôt, while republicans sell/push the shit out of policies that are completely against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of people. 75% of country support roe v wade, 80% want amnesty for daca
the real fascism is deficit spending!
i was watching a video abt finnish prisons on stream and half the chat was contemplating a 25 year sentence there to get free healthcare, lodging and a free education.
i for one cannot wait for 4 years of austerity as we get back to fiscal responsibility!!!!!
why are y‚Äôall doing this down here
brandon you look hot man
same :)
thanks for the leaks ken i used to hate the fbi but now i love them and think they‚Äôre doing the best job ever!
Mainstream media should be having on Black, Latinx, Muslim, Asian, and progressive voices who've been doing the unsung work for years in places like AZ, WI, MI, MN, PA, and GA instead of these Lincoln Project grifters.
This is incredibly sickening.   
CRITICAL LEVELS OF COPIUM DETECTED  
ITS TIME FOR THE WEEKLY SNL BRAIN FLATTENING  
Joe Biden will win the popular vote by over 4 million votes. The Democratic nominee for president has now won the popular vote in 7 out of the last 8 elections. One person, one vote. Democracy must rule.
Yes. We should abolish the electoral college. 
Progressive get attacked by other Dems.
Everyone  silent
Progressives defend themselves and their democratic base.
Everyone  stop being divisive 
Maybe people should stop attacking progressives and work on unity instead of projecting. 
Just a friendly reminder    isn‚Äôt the enemy or a threat, she is an asset to our party.
When you allow the GOP to dictate who should be included in our ‚Äúbig tent‚Äù party, we all lose.
For god‚Äôs sake, the GOP has QAnon members in their ranks and won‚Äôt throw them under the bus.   
perhaps the wildest part of kenneth copeland is that he literally looks and sounds like a demon.  
DAYCARE IS NOW OPEN POST ELECTION COVERAGE THEN SUNDAY FUNDAY WHERE WE WILL BE WATCHING CHAPPELLE ON SNL.  
you really think a supermajority of dems believe the russiagate shit to the same degree as the way rachel maddow promoted it?
many people are saying i didn‚Äôt finish ds3 but it‚Äôs only because i never killed an optional boss, the nameless king, who was a loser anyway. folks- if i secure a ps5, i will play demon souls to completion!
can i get a valhalla early access code please gotta dust off the ol norweigan accent for some gaming?  
Why are people surprised that party establishment folks want to deflate the momentum behind movements? If the pressure wasn‚Äôt working they wouldn‚Äôt be trying to dispel people of the notion that it was
is this the ‚Äúmore black female prison guards‚Äù meme? but irl wow
bernie definitely suffered in black outreach, but i don‚Äôt think it was because he didn‚Äôt appeal to people with blue check marks on twitter enough. maybe i‚Äôm wrong tho who knows.
as i was typing this i came to that conclusion as well. nothing better than gridlock and talking about civility while you wave your hands in the air for four years
kyle you‚Äôre wrong democrats wanted to steal the election by giving biden the presidency but losing seats in the house and not getting him the senate majority so it‚Äôs useless
same :(
Im not a freaking brand risk.
it is, he was talking about permanent war and how it was a necessity cus ‚Äúthey hate us for our freedom‚Äù or some shit
heated gamer moment over a congressman who loves arming saudis w weapons
since january 1st 2019, i've streamed nearly every single day with the exception of bans (8/21) and some days off in 2019 when i was also full time at tyt. if i didn't have the best community ever, i'd never be able to do it.  
With a lot of talk about Native voting in Arizona. I thought I would share 2 maps. The left is a map showcasing all 22 tribes in the state. The right an updated 2020 voting results maps by precinct. This give you an idea of how Indigenous communities voted in the 2020 election.  
not watching this on purpose yet. so we can watch it together tomorrow. :)  
listen if they don‚Äôt like something they let their voices be heard, they yell at me all the time.
this is 100% true  
they beat clemson but they ain‚Äôt beating covid  
ü¶Ä TRUMP IS GONE ü¶Ä  
POBOX TIME  
i fear the next four years is going to be bidens admin not even confirming a single judge because of an obstructionist senate, as biden exclusively talks about how many concessions he's willing to make to republicans in order to fix our deficit.
man has wanted 1 job for 30 years I'd jog too
NO TAKE BACKS. HES ALREADY PRESIDENT ELECT
joe biden's hairline moves more than lebron james's
little max rose spent the waning days of his campaign railing against progressives instead of focusing on his race then got obliterated on election day  
watching president elect biden's speech soon!  
yo   we have to figure out a way to do remote streaming so we can converse over this.  
CNN journalists and the Navy SEALs have both improved the lives of Americans an equal amount. you two don't have to fight  
if i was kurt, i'd mind my own business, but no.  
yo   this is a lotta big boy talk coming from a dude who watches tentacle porn.  
hey  ,  ,  ,  , and    - i'd love to have y'all on to talk about the future of the progressive movement and organizing efforts!!!!!!!!
hey  , you age restricted another video of mine because they're confused. this isn't fake news. it's literally me covering the misinformation spread by republicans on vote counts.  
this man?  
The democratic base run up the numbers in urban areas, with record voter registration following the murder of George Floyd.
The far-left delivered with record turnout, tell me again how Biden did in Ohio?
Stop taking this man seriously, he did lose to Trump after all.   
saying a prayer for all the people who got so upset about woke tweets over the past four years that they turned into republicans, stanning mitch mcconnell‚Äôs calls for sensible deficit reduction will hit different, i promise you
nopium  
LMAO NETFLIX GAVE A SHOW TO SARAH COOPER AND NOW TRUMP ISNT EVEN PRESIDENT WTF IS SHE GONNA LIPSYNC NOW HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA

CNN AP NBC ABC SAID FUCK IT I‚ÄôM CALLING IT!!!!!
tyranny of minority  gt; tyranny of majority
it‚Äôs so much better that our parents post lame shit like this instead of qanon memes w minions on em
they‚Äôre making fun of a campaign hemorrhaging money that can only buy shuttles one way for its rallies that‚Äôs spending 50% of its litigation fundraising on debt relief.
dude cmon.
cut the malarkey jack!
how tf are people remastering games and no one has done kotor 1-2 it would literally be the greatest game of all time and make 1 (one) trillion dollars.
tbf the working class also posts cringe. like a lot of the time.
if you only think about black and brown people whenever criminal justice reform comes up, but not when we‚Äôre talking about the working class- you‚Äôre telling on yourself that‚Äôs a you problem.
it‚Äôs raining in la !!!!!!!!!
when leftists say working class they mean everyone unless they‚Äôre corny af
i‚Äôm just gonna let you know ahead of time that‚Äôs because of aoc and the progressive causes like ‚Äúpublic option‚Äù and ‚Äúraising the minimum wage to $15‚Äù these things simply don‚Äôt poll well in georgia and the heartland.

Fox anchor  Can I asked you about the fact that the Trump campaign says their poll watchers weren't allowed in? 
Fox correspondent  That's not true. It's not true. It's just not true. ... The claim from the president is not true, it is false. Trump campaign lawyers admitted that   
Watch how fast a conspiracy is born during a protest at the Maricopa county election center. Some people are convinced news vans parked in media spots are sneaking in ballots. We tried to explain its just camera equipment. They weren‚Äôt having it.      
absolutely
HICCUP FIXED. WE'RE LIVE AGAIN  
experiencing some technical difficulties. my pc seemed a bit fried for a moment with alot of stuttering. will reboot and get back on asap.
HELLO DAYCARE IS OPEN. THE ELECTION IS COMING TO A CLOSE!  
Joseph Robinette Biden is now undeniably the craziest white boy in the entire country
maybe it‚Äôs time to start backing prog policies. its an uphill battle against reaganomics in this country since the dems fully adopted neoliberalism, but we must restore faith in govt  amp; its capability in improving peoples lives. otherwise republicans will keep ‚Äústarving the beast‚Äù
‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù was an activist movement. the dems obv didn‚Äôt listen to them. if you think aoc  amp; the left is the reason republicans won downballot you are delusional. right wing media successfully made kamala harris into an ‚Äúanticop radical marxist‚Äù stop accepting gop framing
Oh nooo what if Democrats‚Äô biggest electability problem is fueled by a fundamental crisis of information and news consumption by the electorate that is not comparable to any other industrialized democracy oh noooo  
2020 season finale. maga copium. today will be a fun day.
he means the malaysian conservative party.
do not be fooled, these are lies. everyone told you this was a referendum election on trump and that this method was clearly successful because   look at the polls  - well, the polls were grossly wrong. AGAIN. dems lost seats in the house and couldn't take majority in the senate
in the upcoming weeks establishment dems and media will try to 
-call this a massive dub by talking abt the popular vote difference especially after CA runs up the numbers
-admit downballot underperformance, but attribute blame to the left,   defund the police   and socialism 
my man barely ever dipped for below 90% approval rating among republicans for 4 years, and even years in to his presidency, whenever I brought this important factor up liberals looked at me super confused like they believe trump is an aberration.
i talk about how maga and build the wall is economic policy and natsec all the time. HOWEVER this is perhaps your best take overall and you are correct about trump's awful campaigning. we also should recognize that he crushed it for the republicans which def spells future trouble
even after his disastrous covid  mishandling, trump has gotten more votes than Obama did in 2008. if you think the republican party wasn't ALWAYS the trump party and vice versa you need to stop watching msnbc.
i assume it‚Äôs like vr porn, sounds good in theory - leaves you very empty and sad afterwards.
I keep watching this again and again and crying. He gets it 100% right.  
ryan it sounds like your ideas would be best heard on a streaming platform maybe?
this is old lady porn
the republican party is extremely ungrateful to a president who actually did do an incredible amount for the conservative project. ofc that‚Äôs also the reason the country is on fire.
Every Republican must, must, must, must be treated as an enemy of democracy by the mainstream press  
i‚Äôve seen enough.
btw, what we‚Äôre watching now ‚Äî late-counted votes from one side‚Äôs supporters changing who‚Äôs in the lead ‚Äî is exactly what happened in Bolivia where they count rural votes last. 
It was obviously not fraud then but the OAS and US media used it to oust him. 
hey craig, fuck yourself. and all 68 million of those americans.  
if you‚Äôre a Trump supporter who isn‚Äôt a total mark, you should probably be pretty upset right now that he didn‚Äôt have a plan to steal this. no Baker waiting to take the case. no coordination. he Robby Mooked this one
trump literally in the same breath said  we will win the election easilythere will be a lot of litigation... 
trump sounds like a big wet loser. very low energy. sad!!
trump just called joe biden, mr. biden. it's over.
t is claiming polls showing biden winning by high margins were to suppress gop turnout,  amp; raise money for dems. that's not how this works, high polling numbers would make some dems in the margins comfortable. that's why biden kept advertising polls he was losing, to raise money
trump's  big red wave  apparently features him losing the presidential race
trump just said  if you count the legal votes, I win. if you count the illegal votes, they win 
WATCHING THIS WHEN IT GOES LIVE    
can we get some hasmods going in teh chat for trump
this shit is so braindead, the democrat who lost to fucking kara eastman in the primaries literally endorsed the republican. meanwhile a dsa backed $15 min wage ballot measure got more votes in FL than either party's presidential candidate.  
kelly ward just called fox news socialist for calling arizona at this campaign presser in phoenix  
Why do we listen to people who lost elections as if they are experts in winning elections?
McCaskill tried her approach. She ran as a caravan-hysteria Dem amp; lost while grassroots organizers won progressive measures in MO. Her language here shows how she took her base for granted.   
these people need to be purged from the party. progressive ballot measures like increasing $15 min wage pass in general elections. it‚Äôs the democrats that are unlikable, not progressive ideals.  
DAYCARE IS OPEN! WE WILL FIND OUT WHO WON TODAY!!! YALLA LESGOOOO!!! JOIN NOW.  
hopefully we can wrap this election thing up today so i can go back to complaining about the democratic party and also not being able to get a ps5 preorder
Biden will have won the majority of American voters by millions.
Instead of rewarding McConnell and the GOP while they are literally trying to steal the election, Biden should make the case for why he represents the will of the people and deliver for the people who elected him.   
liberals ! next time you wanna yell at activists about wanting to defund the police think about it from the framework that they‚Äôre 800k heavily armed, undertrained trump supporters who have 0 accountability and you‚Äôre really out here trynna give em more money to spend on guns??
probably alarmist but i constantly think about how 800,000 unaccountable heavily armed men that voted for trump by 84% might not do too much in terms of stopping protests from the right wing militias.
right now if they stopped the count in the entire country trump would lose since biden would have arizona and nevada. he would no longer need pennsylvania, georgia or north carolina. this is an impressively stupid and self defeating command.  
The Chad Twitch Streamer vs the virgin national news network  
this is literally how conservative twitter looks right now   
But the problem for Trump is that he needs to replicate that performance across all of the remaining 530,000 votes left to count in AZ. And he needs to do it across all Arizona's 15 diverse counties, which include areas that are very blue  Pima, Coconino, Santa Cruz counties.  
me that‚Äôs my stream.
Very responsible of the Democrats to rig the election, but not take the Senate or a supermajority in the House
The News is seemingly purposefully ignoring Native Americans again (even when talking about Arizona!) 
But there are SIX STATES where the Native voting population is higher than Trumps win margin. Considering Natives have the biggest room for voter turnout growth, maybe care?   
i was wrong, this is what it actually was  
Last night's Twitch stream was so thoroughly modern that I was actually able to calm down.  
I present to you, the Trump campaign‚Äôs legal argument   
uh sorry jordan,   is officially a friend of the show.
:)
DSA won 28 of 37 national races, 8 of 9 major ballot initiatives ranging‚Äî on rent control, living wage, tax the rich, carbon emissions, supporting schools‚Äîall written and organized by chapters. We now have democratic socialist caucuses in 14 statehouses including Montana.
Cannabis legalization won all over the place, a minimum wage initiative won by almost 30 points in Florida while Biden lost it, and this is your takeaway?  
free speech, even in the us has limitations. this absolutely is an incitement for violence as someone w a massive platform like this is lying about election results. you can‚Äôt yell fire in a crowded theater and the president should not be able to do this.
Duality of man  
Guys it's simple. You have to stop in Georgia, keep going in Arizona, stop in Pennsylvania, keep going in Nevada, stop in North Carolina, recount Wisconsin, and ultimately let Brett Kavanaugh weigh in on all of it. That's what the Founders would have wanted.  
that's food you fucking moron.  
oh wow, NOW charlie wants to count all the votes. I agree.

truly devastating moment for coomer rights if the sick puritans of north carolina chose tillis because cal coomingham was a little lip hungry.
come on the show    
biden's trying to do the unifying rhetoric, when 60+ million voted for a dude who's in the process of trying to forcibly steal the election with a supreme court the republican party packed. impressively silly.
It seems like biden is on track to win (predictable) even though it's marginal (underperforming) and he's talking about it live.  
yo   pls come on the broadcast.
wow! incredible article from   on last night's 16 hour marathon election coverage! love to see journalists who are naturally interest in the platforms they cover!  
IM LIVE AGAIN LETS GO WHO WON WHO LOST WE SHALL MAYBE FOUND OUT TODAY! INSHALLAH.  
this is a great point. i was using liberal voice. political capital is what you make it. dems need to also have more backbone on their agenda and come across as assertive against republican attacks.  
don‚Äôt worry i‚Äôm not a democratic party consultant. i obv wouldn‚Äôt compare cubans to other latino voters. i‚Äôm referring to latino turnout elsewhere. even then, it‚Äôs greatly divided by age and a multitude of factors.
a presidential win without the senate is absolutely disastrous for the democrats. they're already foolishly risk averse when it comes to expending political capital, and now they will suffer under an obstructionist senate.
okay i'm up and i'll be live at 11am pacific. real sicko shit.
I am not saying this to be a prick. I want to see Democrats like this get to the bottom of why they eat so much shit in congressional races  
Trump just won the highest share of non-white support of any Republican in 60 years. The Democratic Party is an absolute joke.
white liberals working at ad agencies all around the country are logging on to find out how  disappointing  it is that trump did very well w latinos.  they don't owe anyone anything. get mad at the dems for their awful fucking strategy. get mad at the pollsters for lying to you.
Zapata County, Texas is the second most Hispanic county in America.
In 2012, Obama won it by 43 points.
In 2016, Hillary won it by 33 points.
In 2020, Biden lost it by 5 points.
What a disaster. 
it‚Äôs so funny that the hotdog man w a jet ski dealership is right about polls being fucking wrong - idc how much the nerds try to justify it.
lots of ‚Äúi told you so‚Äù moments after last night. wow. turns out a referendum vote where you focus on never trump republicans wasn‚Äôt exactly a good strategy...
i am sorry i couldn‚Äôt go on any longer than 16 hours, i was dying a little bit. excited to find out what happens tomorrow when we‚Äôll know who‚Äôs the next president. tune in at 11 30am pacific... updates on instagram.
UPDATE  After a spectacular 16 hour stream,   has gone offline! This stream was one for the history books, maxing out at 230K viewers, while gaining over 10K subs! Thank you all for tuning in, and see you all tomorrow!
tbf ofc arizona should keep counting the votes. as well as every other county and state. this is absolutely insane.
trump just claimed that arizona should keep counting the votes because he's losing there when nearly all votes are counted, whereas in michigan and pennsylvania where millions of mailed in early votes haven't been counted yet should immediately halt and declare him the winner.
this is absolutely disastrous. the media should either not be covering the speech, or correcting every single thing trump's saying currently.
trump is now claiming that he won PA,  we're up by 690k votes 
he's dancing around trying to claim victory. just falsely claimed he won NC. very upset about Arizona, he won't even mention fox news by name.
trump is live and eating his original words on calling the election immediately tn.  
Our sisterhood is resilient.  
trump put himself in a hilarious bind with this calling the election on nov 4 because currently (after fox called arizona) he's down in the electoral college and neither candidate has 270. now he has to go on stage and ask people to wait.
i like to think i made him delete this
this kind of anti polish rhetoric i cannot stand for!  
BIDEN IS NOW LIVE  
Just gonna ride out the rest of the night with this stream and dream of a needle-less world

This idea that everyone can relax and go to sleep and stop paying attention once the Good Parents, Joe  amp; Kamala, are in charge is creepy and authoritarian but is exactly what happened on 1/20/2009 when the anti-war, civil liberties  amp; anti-corporatist movement vanished overnight.
thinking about whether or not my ps5 preorder from bestbuy fell through. an absolute disaster.
i technically worked there :)

Don Jr. wanted a hug at the final rally of the 2020 campaign, but daddy said no way.  
i cannot sleep any more, i‚Äôm tired and i have to get rest to keep streaming through the night
on the same day trump defended the YALLqaeda truck convoy running the biden harris bus out of texas, police pepper sprayed a peaceful demonstration marching to the polls in north carolina.
i think it‚Äôs insane that rich people complain about taxes. i hope my opinion doesn‚Äôt change. i am very fortunate and don‚Äôt mind paying more. people who complain about it are scumbags.
this is probably a good sign tho  
what i look like paying 30% in taxes  - lil pump, who's losing 50% of his income to his record label
people don‚Äôt believe me but it‚Äôs true.  
lil pump is at the michigan rally. trump just called him lil pimp.
CORN POP MADE A RETURN!!!! AT THE TRUMP RALLY!! YESS
each doctor held a different part of my body  trump in kenosha
trump is currently crying about an election he hasn't even lost yet- as though he has, including criticizing the supreme court.
The main downfall of the conservative legal project is that half its fascism freaks are also law freaks. The Scalias and Barretts want to run the country straight into the ground but the Robertses and Gorsuches keep making them show their work.
#BREAK Election eve and Twitter has labeled a Trump tweet as misleading.  Removed ability for tweet to be retweeted.  
High school students broke this story using Kentucky‚Äôs FOIA statute  
IM LIVE 1 DAY OUT FROM ELECTION. YALLA LETSGO  
even   admits this. he says suppression from previous elections is already factored in- except, the new methods of purging are hard to predict and nearly impossible to calculate the impact of
universal mail in ballots and early voting during covid drastically changed the dynamic making it significantly easier for more dems to vote. except it also opened up new avenues of suppression and purging. absolutely zero models can factor republican efforts.
this election, just like most US elections - comes down to how many votes are suppressed or outright purged by the republican party. (conservatives)

TRUMP AHEGAO TRUMP AHEGAO TRUMP AHEGAO  
oh boy, trump is wilding out on his 5th rally tonight. 12 am rally in florida
The president has now started assessing Biden's body while fantasizing about beating him up. He says,  Those legs. Those legs have gotten very thin. Not a lot of base. You wouldn't have to close - you wouldn't have to close the fist. 
I'm noticing increasing hatred towards Substack, as if independent reporting creates distrust. It's a bizarre authoritarian strain, last seen in the mid-2000s dismissal of 'bloggers' who didn't like the war in Iraq. Blogger ethics panel!
DAYCARE IS OPEN! 2 DAYS OUT FROM ELECTION. WE DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN NO NUT NOVEMBER AROUND THESE PARTS! JOIN NOW!  
i will be live in a min okay i had to work our before my stream !  
We had a president for whom  ball is life  now we have one who  bought his wife   
it works on democracy now imo
i think most progressives who claimed they‚Äôd be junior partners are like the ‚Äúreasonable republicans‚Äù who wanted to ‚Äúsave democracy‚Äù and be the adult in the room to trump. some have honorable yet misguided goals, most just want to write a book
this notion that votes already cast that will get counted after nov 3 is  stealing  or  tipping  the election is absolutely insane. the media have backpacked biden up until this point, if they actually fuck this part up on election night i will lose my mind.

A Democratic upset in a 2018 race for   Harris County judge   just might deliver Texas to Biden. Meanwhile, recent Dem wins in PA State Supreme Court races could thwart voter suppression in that tipping-point state.

goddamnit i‚Äôm at the gym.
the constant white nationalist paramilitary coverage from msm has a real 2016 ‚Äúthis nazi is just a boy next door‚Äù feel to it. how are journalists still so fucking awful at this sort of thing. just picture them as bernie bro‚Äôs who just left a snake emoji under your tweet pls  lt;3
anyone who believes corbyn deserved to be suspended, for absolutely correctly without a shred of uncertainty pointing out that the media and tories and the even internal blairite saboteurs elevated criticisms of antisemitism in the party  is a complete dupe or bad faith.
the  Equality and Human Rights Commission , which decided to investigate anti-English racism in Welsh universities and anti-semitism in Labour, has just decided they won't investigate Islamophobia in the Tory party. That's because it's basically a propaganda agency of the Tories  
lmao you can't make this shit up  
judging by how things went in the uk- can‚Äôt wait for the biden democratic party to run a civility committee led by kasich where they finger wag at the ‚Äúangry bernie bro coalition‚Äù
LOL SHE ONCE CALLED CONCENTRATION CAMPS FOR MIGRANT CHILDREN ‚ÄúSUMMER CAMP‚Äù
no he didn‚Äôt. you are a liar. also you moved the fucking goalpost to ‚Äúborderline‚Äù comments now- which is still not true. spare me the 700 articles written by dipshit guardian columnists. israel is also an apartheid regime you donkey.
they did this shit w bernie too. the democratic majority of israel pac was the first to attack him in the primaries. they called him an anti semite. it didn‚Äôt stick.
Corbyn‚Äôs suspension from Labour is one final bit of sadism in this years-long grotesque farce; it‚Äôs made worse when you remember that the majority of the charges came from a single person. If you fell for that shit you are a fucking sucker
this dude spent his life fighting apartheid regimes. this is a reminder to anyone speaking truth to power. they will find anything they can to end you, and if they can‚Äôt find anything they‚Äôll fabricate it.  
i owned these gucci colorway creative recs back in the day. this means i‚Äôm basically italian.

having said that repealing section 230 is the most idiotic way of trying to fix this problem. hilarious that republicans are advocating for it - as they‚Äôre the ones who‚Äôd get hurt the most, if platforms actually had to clean up their timeline.
fb and twitter have done almost as much as roger ailes to destroy american democracy. conservative content is amplified esp on fb, and these apes still cry abt censorship.
little does trump know you‚Äôre out here making sure he doesn‚Äôt get that extra ec vote
nah i think i‚Äôm gonna stay here. suck my entire ass.

dude he is being annoying as fuck. he doesn‚Äôt know a single vote that has been cast yet. i‚Äôm sorry i hate it when poll guys turn into pundits.
if donald trump's campaign was doing alright he wouldn't be trying to lock down a single electoral college vote from omaha. they believe they have a pathway to victory that is an incredibly narrow one.
i will never understand this aren‚Äôt ppl already hard to deal w as it is?
he‚Äôs got it and he‚Äôs flaunting it
white feminism is peak content
To be clear  There isn't a *single* state that certifies its results *on* Election Day. When elections are called, it's because of media *projections,* not the   final total.   Indeed, federal law gives states at least five *weeks* to certify their results 
If they even TRY to replace RBG we burn the entire fucking thing down.
Remember that Republicans have lost 6 of the last 7 popular votes, but have appointed 6 of the last 9 justices.

401ks have also made workers feel as though they have a serious stake in the stock market and falsely equate the market doing well w/ their own economic security.
one other fascinating thing i have observed in the incredibly marginal but very vocal parts of the online left is their interest in turning every interaction to a transaction where labor must be compensated for, even emotional labor. it‚Äôs like an ancap wet dream.  
sometimes i make fun of a link that someone spammed in the chat and then think about how i demoralized that person in front of 20k people. i‚Äôm sorry if i did that to you.

fucking kill me. just run me over w a car. i don‚Äôt want her to be a socialist, she‚Äôs not one. who cares. i want her to defend policies that she co-signed that are still tangential to bidens own policies.
every-time they shit on socialized medicine they personally add another hurdle to the battle they have to fight even for the public option (which idk if they will fight for it) same w green new deal, which bidens bbb plan is similar to.
i cannot think of a worse way of answering any of these questions. kamala harris isn‚Äôt a socialist obv. she just wants power. but have some fucking backbone for popular policies that are also good for the people.

thinking current kanye will capture a significant chunk of the black vote is so delusional that a republican must‚Äôve come up w it. actually even they prolly didn‚Äôt believe it but said fuck it, why not when they offered maga lawyers to help kanye file.
listening to the parts i missed of the kanye interview, and he‚Äôs 100% correct when he says the liberal writers who scolded him about ‚Äúsplitting the black vote away from joe biden‚Äù are racist.
this is just false
kanye west is so close yet so so so far

dems consistently undermine their self-proclaimed project of building robust social safety nets every single time criticize socialized medicine, or m4a w/ insane right wing claims that people actually love blue cross blue shield, or big pharma

FINALLY FUCKING BIDEN SAYS  IT WAS A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS  THAT STOPPED THEIR ADMIN EVERY STEP OF THE WAY!!!!! WHY IS THAT SO FUCKING HARD FOR DEMS TO MENTION?!?!!?!??!!
i know. my point is that his bill is worse than his justification for it.
this is lyndon b johnson erasure sir!!!!
trump 3 minutes later   I am the least racist person in this room   
biden is doing very well so far. having said that it's remarkable that he can claim to be a truth teller when all of his most famous gaffes revolve around him lying about his past. but then again, the media didn't really cover that too extensively. a testament to their power.
it's funny that trump claims that biden said  superpredators  that was hillary defending biden's crime bill. which was significantly worse for black people than someone calling a black person a superpredator. but ofc white liberals love hyperfocusing on the aesthetics.
while it is true that obama in fact built the cages, AND deported more people in his first 4 years. Trump absolutely expanded on his immigration enforcement and used child separation as a deterrent.
okay joe biden is actually hitting the correct lines on immigration, esp defending  catch and release  where the majority of people apprehended would show up to their court date to seek asylum.
okay to be fair obama DID build the cages. trump is ofc much much worse and used child separation as a deterrent.
trump is arguing about how the 500 kids who will never be reunited with their parents are taking care of in great condition.
trump doesnt wanna bail out corrupt democrat cities
we are the worst at taking care of ourselves. only in the us can you use  he wants socialized medicine  as an attack.
joe biden is about to pull a  i fucking love fracking  take on private insurance. wish the dems had positioned and messaged better on private insurance instead of also attacking socialized medicine since the public option will be a hard battle if dems even wish to fight it
trump eliminated  the worst parts of obamacare  so why is he still trying to repeal it when the rest of it (preexisting conditions) is good???
the moderator is doing a very good job overall and absolutely stopped trump from talking about hunter biden's alleged connection to china and even redirected his squirrel brain onto another shiny object
i cant be the only one uncomfortable by both parties trying to outmuscle one another on a more militant approach to dealing with china
trump paid more taxes in china from 2010-2015 than he did in federal taxes in the us
trump is hitting the democrat line about how much he's arming ukraine. do americans care about this? hardline blue no matter who people think he's a russian puppet, and maga people believe he isn't. do any moderates care about russiagate or giving tankbusters to ukraine?
YOU ARE WRONG HE LOOKS HOT
this seems like a lock for biden, but it would be nice if he mentions how republicans are deliberately refusing to vote on the house stimulus package for months
everytime trump mentions how china mitigated the spread within china, he basically tells people that china was better at stopping covid than we are.
trump keeps blaming gold star families for giving him covid - it's perhaps the worst way to remind ppl you got covid.
joe biden is actually very energetic today
trump is looking hot. very brown. the steroid is hitting. you're all thinking it.
TRUMP HAS GOT AN ABSOLUTE DUMPER STILL THIS ANGLE REALLY BRINGS IT OUT
WE ARE LIVE NOW!!! GET IN    
You didn‚Äôt have to snitch like that man ü§£  
Trump to   60 Minutes   in footage he posted 
Trump  ‚ÄúI never said lock up the governor.  
Stahl    So you don't want to lock up the governor?  
Trump    Lesley, that‚Äôs such a vicious thing you just said. I never said lock up the governor of Michigan. I would never say that.‚Äù   
YOU ALREADY KNOW WHERE THE REAL ACTION IS 5PM PACIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the final debate is tn AND this just dropped. my lord.  
british terfs are so fucking cool like wtf is going on in that brain.
this is a spoiled ass tweet ik- it‚Äôs my one decadent indulgence. the gym is also completely outdoors  amp; the number of people allowed to workout is limited. but i can never book a time slot. like every single day is booked completely. so i‚Äôm a little confused abt what im paying for
yo   it was already insanely expensive to pay for your gym, even pre covid, and then you opened up a gym on top of a parking lot which was nice. but it‚Äôs kind of insane if you think you can charge people when every session at the gym is fully booked the whole week.
ofc it‚Äôs not. it‚Äôs just anti social safety nets
wait this lowkey slaps if it‚Äôs anti means testing
bro americans love tom brady and he literally french kisses his child i get that this is an odd photo shoot but are they really going w, biden loves his son too much?
i‚Äôm a maoist third wordlist for joe biden

ayyyyy the president shouted out   again!!!!
trump opened up his NC rally by calling out  the deep state  which he apparently has made nervous along with the democratic party  
wrote about how last night showed how streamers like 
have built out the infrastructure on twitch to make it one of the few online tools for progressive like aoc and omar that hasn't been overrun by the right yet     
lmao just re write the tweet man it‚Äôs got like 30 likes then ill   it
omg. the quarter pounder.
barack obama is a remarkable orator. we forgot how charismatic establishment democrats can be, if they rolled up their sleeves and hit the high notes they need to hit. no wonder our democratic gerontocracy is so reliant on how bad the republicans are to win elections  amp; fundraise
watching obama do a gotv rally in pa.  
incredibly well written article on last night's #gotv efforts and why   is a really great platform to reach people

why was kanye running for vp on my ballot ?
just friggen voted so hard
this way, if nature calls (for a crank) we can do it on mute.
there are 8x more republican votes for president in california than nebraska. a fact i always think about whenever trump says blue states are going to hell and don‚Äôt deserve any relief.
the new york times had a story up about jeffrey tobin jacking off on a conference call several hours faster than it did the bolivian people taking power back from a fradulent, us-backed regime
should i finally watch king of the hill (never seen it) will this make me understand texas better ?
i can‚Äôt tell if this is real or a meme
the only tangible impact of this mostly symbolic gesture is how much is triggers racist people
this election cycle is wild as always, but the ps5 is coming out and so is cyberpunk. i am nervous for the future of the country but excited for a lot of gaming opportunities.

The US state department on their way to congratulate Bolivia's next president after his historic win tonight  
the associated press take on bolivia‚Äôs election results even AFTER the president conceded is pretty hilarious.  
right wingers are upset at this tweet please check quote tweets for hilarious takes. also, no shit-  i obv don‚Äôt want to fund american imperialism.
a lot of people are celebrating, but no one has even bothered to ask if the cia gave consent to bolivia‚Äôs election results

i think trump's appeal in 2016 beyond the obvious ones was that he  called it how it is  and usually went beyond the dogwhistles like calling mexicans rapists. he's not actually saying what he means by  protecting the suburbs  so it's probably going over the heads of the hogs
TRUMP IS LIVE AND WE'RE WATCHING HIS MICHIGAN SUPER SPREADER EVENT  
DAYCARE IS NOW OFFICIALLY OPEN AND WE'RE HAVING FUN TODAY  
you didn‚Äôt do it enthusiastically enough which also is the same as voting for trump.
Did any media outlet publish or excerpt the Steele dossier before the 2016 election? Buzzfeed published it on January 10, 2017. 
yoooooooooooooooooooooooo
i think they‚Äôll just a launch barrage of civil suits against platforms against liberal and leftist users to make more trouble for platforms that otherwise wouldn‚Äôt bother liberals while simultaneously complaining abt conservative voices being suppressed
wouldn‚Äôt repealing section 230 actually end up w most conservatives getting deplatformed since they‚Äôre the ones violating most terms of service and therefore a liability that corporations wouldn‚Äôt want on their platform ? or do they plan on suing every liberal on each platform?
taxes are actually cool, good and very patriotic to pay
UPDATE  Some Hasan Abi merch is possibly coming soon! Stay tuned!

nice drip
doing a townhall recap with    
trump demonstrably did poorly, probably why sean hannity is avoiding talking about it and is instead focusing on the burisma stuff
The split screen between Joe Biden and Donald Trump tonight is wild. Biden, calmly sitting and talking about infrastructure and mask mandates. Trump, combative and challenging every question as he refuses to denounce QAnon and sows doubt in the election.
trump just lost the radical right
she‚Äôs voting for gloria la riva on the psl ticket i heard
trump is talking about irs being mean to him
trump also pulled the same thing he did w proud boys last week, w qanon just now - where he refused to disavow them
trump is currently getting penetrated live on tv by the moderator and now the townhall voters.
idk if twitter still broken but the TOWNHALL PRESIDENTIAL COVERAGE IS STARTING NOW!!!!!  
I AM LIVE, THE DAYCARE IS OPEN AND TONIGHT IS TOWNHALL NIGHT!!!!!  
if its not a hack how they get personal photos of him unavailable elsewhere? Idk if the email is real (unverifiable atm) but the photos clearly are
I know way too much about the Burisma scandal so you don't need to. Here's why the latest republican  bombshell  on Hunter is more of a dud.  
i love seeing conservatives be gigantic babies all around the planet  
trying to censor the nypost story was somehow even more idiotic than thinking that there's a bombshell revelation in it, or that it was totally hunters laptop, and not a hack.
Because   faced a DSA challenge in her primary, and because there‚Äôs *so much else going on,* her campaign hasn‚Äôt gotten the attention it deserves. 
But this Sunrise-backed, GND+M4A candidate who faced homelessness is on the brink of flipping a red seat   
Another   whoa   fundraising update    raised $5.2 million in Q3. Unheard of for a   front line   freshman who isn't part of leadership.

-hunter biden absolutely used his last name to get a job at burisma trading access for cash (access he didn't have)
-joe biden literally ended up pressuring the ukranian govt to prosecute the company hunter was working for, at the request of international authorities. 
trump immediately hits the joe biden hunter biden nypost story in his iowa rally  
Folks cheering this have the ability to see about 2 inches in front of their face.

Hunter Biden looks like Jordan Peterson on an all-pussy diet.
On this day in 2011, an Obama-ordered drone strike killed 16 year-old American citizen Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, his teenage cousin, and 5 other civilians as they were eating at an outdoor cafe in Southern Yemen.  
went undercover as hank parker to a qanon rally (now rebranded as savethechildren) and this is actually the best thing i've ever done - also andrew from all gas no break is in it too!  
these always look so funny cus your character seems so lonely standing there by itself
this is a good look
i had no idea about the distinctions between sexual preference and orientation as someone who has always believed that sexuality and gender is NOT a choice. i didn‚Äôt see it happening during the hearings but it‚Äôs certainly not something i knew was a deliberate thing ppl did
wtf is sexual preference? did republicans manufacture their own controversy from a brief moment off the hearings or did liberals actually get mad at this?
amy coney barrett is disqualified for claiming she doesn‚Äôt entertain hypotheticals. that‚Äôs literally all lawyers (highest form of reddit debatelord) do.
She doesn't answer their questions because she feels no accountability to them or the process. Just towards Trump and his cult. 
And she'll be no different on the court.   
kanye would prolly do more for kentucky than mitch mcconnell. he‚Äôs a billionaire, the remaining koch brother should let ye experiment in the state for a change- would absolutely be better than the crippling austerity measures tested by those freaks.
this is why he never subbed to me üòî
I hate this 60 minutes ad for the Lincoln Project, who are cynical grifters responsible for creating the racist rhetoric Trump now takes advantage of  
waiting for trump to talk about kissing both guys and girls today  
it's not even a guarantee that republicans will concede to 1.8trillion when pelosi already dropped 1trillion from the original proposal. if she's truly holding out to hurt trump, then republicans would call her bluff. they won't because they can't look like they're working w dems
mitch mconnell has refused to concede to any additional spending for months, the only time nancy pelosi has political capital and is using it to hold her ground against republicans by trying to secure $600B and people are dunking on her? what? this is entirely on the republicans.
i'm certain she wont dismantle ACA either, since you know, she has family members with pre-existing conditions.  
even kavanaugh seems to disagree with amy's interpretation, which you would know if you read the article. also don't you agree this says more about a person's opinion on race (or how they'll operate in scotus) than claiming she has a personal stake in this matter cus of her kids?  
dude what're you saying?????????  
she claimed a supervisor calling a black employee the n-word is not enough evidence to claim that it made it a hostile and distressing work environment. 
I AM LIVE AND WATCHING ACB IN THE SENATE HEARING  
this is not a new discovery of mine
last 60 imo
a lot of people make fun of 17 yo maoists and anarchists on this website, then turn around and have the audacity to actually believe this  
‚Äúactivist judges‚Äù are absolutely a thing republicans do and then project on to their opposition as a line of attack  
i never understood cornbread (too weird for my turkish palate) until i tried it w honey butter, and now i believe either is good as long honey butter is a part of the equation

watching trump's first rally back in florida and ngl, he looks energized  
.  as i said in the dms, i'd love to chat - but I'm not willing to fly across the country. you said you were looking into setting up a remote pod opportunity. unless i'm confused by this.

California is going to hell. Vote Trump!

Yep.  Spike Lee .

wonder why trump last week and even pence last night refused to say yes to overturning roe v wade? those who watch my stream regularly know the answer. roe v wade is popular and better for the republicans to dangle like a carrot in front of evangelicals rather than destroy
bro wtf is happening in ny  
joe biden should absolutely do the townhall next week, only if trump sits in a bubble like bubble boy.
they should arrest him for sexting like a virgin
I wish somebody held my hand as long as the fly stayed on Mike Pence‚Äôs head

OMG THERES A FLY ON MIKE PENCES HEAD AND HE HAS NO IDEA
if kamala pulls a  i love fracking  style backpedal on race and police brutality I will lose my mind
the harris self pauses are so catastrophic just roll the fuck over this limp dick goblin.
trump has been wholly irresponsible w/ covid so much so that he personally got it, and we just let pence get away with that scott free pretty much. also 0 mention of stimulus negotiations so far.
mike pence aborted qasem souleimani
BE LESS THANKFUL SUSAN!!!!!!
i'm sorry mike pence, who is an insanely boring person, is getting away with murder right now. he has had to address so little of his admins incompetence and rampant corruption - constantly pushing kamala to defend biden over ridiculous points. cutting her off. not answering qs
joe biden has been a cheerleader for communist china! 
kamala harris bout to pull a hickenlooper and drink fracking juice on stage to prove how much she fucking loves fracking. (while believing in science)
WE LOVE TO FRACK BUT BELIEVE IN SCIENCE, WE WILL STILL FRACK EVEN IF SCIENCE TELLS US TO MOVE AWAY FROM US. BUT WE WILL DO IT WHILE BELIEVING IN SCIENCE
IM GLAD BOTH PARTIES LOVE TO FUCKING FRACK
mike pence is literally the return to normalcy republican it is actually not as bad as I thought it.
this format is absolute dogshit, if media wasn't so liberal i'd say they did this to help pence
everytime kamala does that fake nervous smile instead of unloading a magazine into pence, 1000 votes are lost.
RIP HIS FUCKING FACE OFF I WANT TO SEE BLOODSHED ARENT YOU A COP KAMALA TREAT HIM LIKE HES A TRUANT KID
he‚Äôs got the biden eye  
MIKE PENCE LEFT EYE IS BLEEDING THATS BAD OPTICS
kamala harris is actually delivering so far ngl. not that it changes anything. but she is actually doing very well.
pence is making it seem like listening to experts is not trusting american people to do the right thing on their own. insanely individualistic false dichotomy especially when it demonstrably has failed.

ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î but the liberals in my audience and on the subreddits claim this is a referendum election, and any policy mention by dems opens up a line of attack against them ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î  
everyday donald trump sounds and campaigns more like a democrat, talking about his own russiagate (obamagate) crying about voting, sad !
kamala harris vs mike pence debate coverage will start at 5pm pacific - guest hosts   +   no cover byob    
VERY EXCITED TO WATCH MAMALA VS MIKE PENCE TODAY ITS NOT GONNA BE WILD LIKE TRUMP V BIDEN BUT THE CONTENT IS THERE W HOW MUCH BAD STUFF KEEPS HAPPENING TO REPUBLICANS
Mr. President  You attack ‚Äúsocialized medicine‚Äù every single day. Well, let's be clear. The excellent care you received at Walter Reed was at a 100% government-funded, government run hospital. For Trump,  socialized medicine  is bad for everyone but himself. Total hypocrisy!
eastern promises is the only movie to correctly portray what goes on in turkish bathhouses, will watch it for this reason alone
you‚Äôre telling me this is post true detective mcconaughey? wow.
i have so many questions
people are saying you shouldn‚Äôt fuck people who read this book- once again i would like to mention, i do not read.
what‚Äôs infinite jest, i don‚Äôt read
you can play it on your phone or ipad, not sure about a macbook
love to see republicans run like democrats.
get on the among us wave
lmao
mitch has been holding off on a second package for months despite the wh trying to put something together. i think trump wanted to act like he was in control after mcconnell called him to tell him it‚Äôs not happening. also cus he‚Äôs high asf
who tf plays w motion blur lol
no the first part is what i‚Äôm confused by not the backpedaling.
does anyone understand why trump weirdly took ownership of stopping stimulus negotiations earlier today only to backpedal in a twitter frenzy later?
You only need like 150k votes to win a Senate race in Alaska. It‚Äôs always been a highly underrated opportunity to steal a seat, because the cost of taking a shot is low.  
YO WE GOT   IN THE HOUSE REVIEWING MEME MUSIC.  
my mans high as fuck  
This time next week he'll be doonstairs with Maggie.
The only logical response to this fuckery, is to vote them out. 
Not by analyzing their cruelty, inaction and irresponsible politics. 
It‚Äôs about power and the people need to reclaim that power on Nov. 3rd.   
ICE deployed armed personnel in response to a tweet from journalist   that contained no threat, per internal docs I obtained after a FOIA lawsuit with my atty  .
HSI Tampa will be carefully assessing the twitter based threats  
I AM LIVE AND ALIVE AND THE DAYCARE IS OPEN HELLO!  
if everyone involved in debate prep us getting covid and the president didn‚Äôt get tested at the debates doesn‚Äôt mean that he very likely had it at the debates? wouldn‚Äôt this be the sole reason why the wh refuses to mention when his first positive test was?
what the actual fuck is going on lmao  
I can‚Äôt be the only guy who thinks Trump‚Äôs breathing has been awesome today
lester holt is trying to  both sides  the first presidential debate and criticizing joe biden for calling trump a clown at this townhall. insane.
it‚Äôs remarkable that he‚Äôs able to walk up stairs 3 days into covid w the treatment he got. you can really see it from this angle.  
donald trump is directly putting lives in danger by continuing to minimize this disease even after he got it. you already have idiots thinking he beat it when he hasn't even had a single negative test yet and he's running around without a fucking mask.
I'm running to bring a progressive voice to the most powerful City Council in America.
We're fighting for a better LA.
Housing for all.
Clean air.
A transformed approach to public safety.
A city where everyone is welcome.
I hope you'll join us.
it is beyond insane to me that the president is trying to claim that he knows covid personally when his treatment and care is unimaginable to the avg american. he's leaving his hospital 3 days in against guidelines, when your grandparents drew their last breathe alone and scared.
DAYCARE IS OPEN AND I AM EXTREMELY EXCITED RN!!!! COME NOW POG  
he thinks it‚Äôs pro cop or doing cop apologia because he prolly saw the first episode and quit when it‚Äôs literally the opposite and the main point is about white supremacy within the police force that connects all the way to the senate
trump supporters STILL don't believe covid is real. even after he got it. (this is the yt video that got me a strike btw)  
i still love it here :)
yes dude. ofc.
the youtube strike matter has been resolved. thank you for putting pressure. and thank you youtube for resolving it. dunno why it was elevated to a full strike when i appealed- maybe cus i called the moderation team fucking brain dead in full caps- but i will do better next time  
dude. cmon. ofc i‚Äôm caught up w the boys.
okay binged thru watchmen and i was wrong. i quit after the first ep when it first came out and i‚Äôm glad i gave it a second try. now i need another show though :(
this dudes def not iraq tho. dunno if he‚Äôs even deployed.
someone made this and it perfectly represents how degenerate and talented my community is  
got bored and made some more cyberpunk things  
not only is this true, but it also signals to his base that they can go out and spread covid freely if they get it and can walk around after testing positive  
isn't it awesome when both of the people running for the most powerful position on the planet are currently doing the  i'm not dying  media tour?  
daycare is open. trump health updates. and how youtube striked in the most ridiculous manner for a covid vid.  
oh wow, because of my appeal they actually increased my warning to a strike.  
Showing they‚Äôre willing and eager to cheer for self-harm and death was extremely important from a clout perspective in the Dutch resistance. It was hard to find ways in those days to show you‚Äôre not a liberal.  
this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if youtube would verify me but for some reason i haven‚Äôt had that happen nor have i gotten a button yet.  
OKAY IM OFFICIALLY LOSING IT!!!!!!!ONE OF MY CLIPS CHANNELS ALREADY UPLOADED THE SEGMENT FROM MY TWITCH STREAM AND THEYRE ALREADY AT 33K VIEWS I WONT FUCKIN SNITCH BUT YOUR PLATFORM IS A GARBAGE FIRE YOUTUBE
the funniest part is i didn‚Äôt even see what was in the video because it got struck down before i woke up to check it before uploading. now that i have seen the video...
IM STILL FUCKIN MAD WHAT THE FUCK   FIX THIS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!‚Äônj 
this is the 2nd time they've done this idiotic thing where me talking about covid misinformation and how stupid these people are for spreading covid misinfo gets striked as covid misinformation. take my channel away from your garbage platform, my clip channels literally do better  
YO   HOW ABOUT YOU DONT GIVE ME A  STRIKE ON MY CHANNEL FOR A VIDEO THAT HASNT EVEN BEEN PUBLISHED YET THATS ABOUT HOW TRUMP SUPPORTERS STILL REFUSE TO BELIEVE CORONAVIRUS IS REAL EVEN AFTER THE PRESIDENT GOT IT. ARE WE NOT ALLOWED TO EVEN TALK ABOUT CORONA DENIERS???
my man seems mad
Everyone who said they‚Äôd riot if trump replaced RBG is now wishing him a speedy recovery
this is what he does on days he‚Äôs not in the hospital as well  
its nice when someone you've idolized considers you a powerful institution despite being a himbo with a twitch stream
glad he's doing well but this is strange  
yes glenn, i should instead chase clout and separate myself from the liberals by yelling about marginal extremely woke sjw's like i'm a fucking 2014 gamergate youtuber and not one of the best investigative reporters on the fucking planet.  
REMEMBER WHEN CONSERVATIVES DEFENDED HER BECAUSE THESE EVIL SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES WERE TRYING TO SILENCE HER VIEWS ON MASK WEARING?!?! REMEMBER? WHERE ARE THOSE CONSERVATIVES NOW
why isn't the demon semen dr stella immanuel who was all over the news touting hydroxychloroquine a couple weeks ago treating trump atm? seems odd that the president wouldn't take the incredible advice he so willingly spread to the public?
the timeline of events revolving trumps covid contraction, esp the doctors contradicting themselves reminds me of  's death of stalin.
daycare is open! we're doing covid watch now!!!  
yeah like famous democrat dennis hastert lmao  
i‚Äôve thought about this as well. perhaps because of the almost successful impeachment where even republicans turned on nixon and his republican approval rating was under 60% whereas trump still has 90% approval in the republican party
ü¶Äü¶Ä TRUMP HAS COVID!ü¶Äü¶Ä  
gross.  
every liberal shaming others and demanding to be nice to trump will 100% remember him fondly like george bush in 5 years when the next republican president is a reanimated hitler on a centaur body. they did this w reagan too.
politician sexting scandals own. it‚Äôs always the guy saying stuff like ‚ÄúI would love to put on my best shirt and circle back to your vagina for hot sex‚Äù and the woman going ‚ÄúSuper! I can‚Äôt wait to make it! sexy!‚Äù just absolute aliens  
I'm sorry, but, lol what the fuck are you talking about  
know its obvious but the possible arc of supreme court justice dies weeks before election, asks not to be replaced, is immediately set to be replaced, resulting in celebration  amp; the celebration becomes superspreader event sending president to hospital is difficult to fully grasp
it‚Äôs wild how much everything has worked in his favor. hillary has to be so pissed that biden gets to malarkey his way into a victory (possibly)
biden has been running on easy mode this entire campaign, think about it 
-bernie threat in primaries leads party to unite behind biden
-global pandemic ruins economy kills ppl, turns his weakness (not enough energy to campaign) into a strength
-opponent catches deadly illness 
Meanwhile... Trump campaign today started running more Facebook attack ads pushing the bogus earpiece conspiracy against Biden, etc     
getting covid to own the libs  
guys, i don't think trump is doing well.
There‚Äôs more cases of Covid in the White House than in all of New Zealand
listening biden LIVE in michigan- i really hope he gloats, just a little bit.  
I‚Äôd avoid one to one comparisons with Bolsonaro and Johnson because they had both won far more recent landslide elections and were both generally more popular than Trump but the worse it gets for him now, the more a full recovery could yield for him. that said this is hilarious
My statement on Trump‚Äôs COVID-19 positive diagnosis   
best redemption arc for a state if ohio IS responsible for trump getting corona
guys i'm starting to think this covid thing is serious, it might not be a hoax after all....
I COULDNT WAIT TO GO LIVE THIS MORNING AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
I looked at Trump vs. Clinton and why 2020 is different than 2016 as Trump is no longer an outsider, but a president who didn't fix the problems he correctly pointed out in 2016  
contact tracing is communism charlie
i promise you bullying people into voting is not the activism you think it is
i tried to sleep this morning and i am incapable
leftists claim trump is bad, meanwhile he‚Äôs about to off more rich ppl than you ever could sweaty üíÖüèº
it‚Äôs wild these mfs kept hope hicks a secret for a min while trump apparently went to his golf course to fundraise without a mask too. hope the staff and people who work around trump are safe. only them tho, everyone else can eat a dick.
BITCH IM CAKED UP ALL ON MY OWN GET YOUR FUCKING FACTS STRAIGHT
Joe Biden called upon Allah at the debate and this is His reward
you ever watch a show and don‚Äôt want to fall asleep because it‚Äôs too good? that‚Äôs how i feel rn, but for real life
bro why is everyone outlet using this photo like she just pulled off the hit?
republican staffers working overtime compiling tweets for the fabricated outrage news cycle tomorrow üëÄ

hope hicks walking away from the grassy knoll  
i should stop posting.
ngl id let hope hicks gimme covid20 if she wants
bruh  
fuck it im saying it
save your wishes for the cashier‚Äôs grandfather who dies alone in the icu, not the fucking president who lied to the public and created 200k more stories like the one above.
yo is covid real or not qanon? i thought it was a fucking hoax karen?
i think the only thing cooler than trump getting covid after downplaying it and killing 200k+ americans is watching all the sicko conservatives cry about how mean the left is.
me at the funeral    
what‚Äôs herman cains acc posting tn?
barron  
Fire up the  It's Always Sunny  theme music  
MSNBC put together a list üëÄ  
real blackpill moment is if trump gave covid to biden who absolutely wouldn‚Äôt make it.
shut up bitch.
Within minutes of Trump saying this, the White House released his public schedule for tomorrow. Trump is not quarantining  He‚Äôs attending a fundraiser at his Washington DC hotel, and hosting a rally in Florida.  
i‚Äôm also gonna mention here for no reason whatsoever that both boris johnson and jair bolsonaro had covid and didn‚Äôt die... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
there won‚Äôt be debates if he‚Äôs actually got it
even if it‚Äôs a negative it could be because it‚Äôs too soon to show but the admin would absolutely release the negative results to quiet speculation and mention that they‚Äôre quarantining for safety until they get a second and third negative test.
i thought the abbott test gave an instant result.... why are they already quarantining. ü§î ü§î ü§î  
my man just wants melania to let her little piggies breathe
when‚Äôs who is america coming back ??????
talking to   about the recent leaks from the intelligence community that directly contradict trump's statements downplaying the threat of white supremacy while trying to claim antifa is an organization.  
brad pitt's greatest accents (and worst)  
p*wdiep*e is swole
the election is in almost a month but so is the new playstation
i just sneezed inside my mask for the first time and antimaskers have a point
i‚Äôm watching the watchmen on hbo, the boys seem more my speed- open to have my mind changed as i dive further into the show tho.
listen sometimes i like to tweet about niche shit that‚Äôs exclusively catering to extremely online people. it‚Äôs very cringe when i do it and it‚Äôs healthy that u don‚Äôt understand anything i just said there.
i agree, anthony fantano is literally stalin
funniest thing about a lot of the left adjacent anti-idpol alt media ppl on here is that they know how fucking idiotic dave rubin and tim pool are, and yet they‚Äôre going through the exact same first stage of their transition grift atm. can‚Äôt wait for the why i left the left vids
sick and tired of seeing poc treated like this
finished succession and desperately need a new show. anime or regular.
what ? i would never in a million years vote for trump. my criticisms of the dems are about their concessions to the republicans. anyone who votes for a republican after claiming to be progressive or a bernie supporter is a fucking moron.
This campaign is for every person fighting against the corrupt systems that make us scrape to have our voices heard. Let‚Äôs rise up.
#RiseAppalachia #NotMeUs 
i could literally wear a ridin w biden shirt and door knock everyday  amp; neolib üåê twitter would still be ready to call me a traitor when i say something like ‚Äúliberals were ready to throw the election when bernie was leading which makes bidens path to victory easier than bernies‚Äù  
this as well  
why do you do this. read the thread charles.
i never saw this before and it‚Äôs incredible.  
üò≥üò≥üò≥  
Yesterday as Trump refused to condemn far-right violence, the FBI quietly issued a  warning about the threat of far-right extremists, per intel report leaked to me.
It identifies the period between presidential election and inauguration as a   flashpoint  
trumps is live after the first debate, and he's crying about chris wallace   
nyt do a writeup about emerging platforms without sounding like a boomer challenge  
I love this conspiracy because the implication is that biden had good moments last night and wasn't just sitting and getting hammered by trump endlessly  
hello, daycare is now open. to all the new friends we made last night. time for a debate recap and more.  
He called racial sensitivity training Racist
this is why trump is having a hard time messaging against biden. you can‚Äôt weaponize the liberal disdain/fear against socialism when you‚Äôre running against ‚Äúthe liberal who beat the socialist‚Äù  
here's my reaction and post debate recap to the 1st presidential debate.  ,   and I try to help you get through the madness.  
trump asked for a single leo group that supports biden. they don‚Äôt exist because a gigantic chunk of the police force is republican. something ppl never seem to talk about.
Im just chilling in hasans stream and i get this message. He's probably still waiting  
it‚Äôs funny to think that america‚Äôs center right and far right party still want to make some room in the middle - but at least they correctly portray centrists as the hideous freaks they are.  
also this tweet acknowledges weaknesses in the sanders outreach plan, while also showing that he wouldn‚Äôt have as easy of a ride to victory as biden and liberals are still psychotically tweeting at me, failing to hear the point i‚Äôm making.
i agree. this is ofc pure speculation but i think it‚Äôs hard to measure without seeing what the media coverage of bernie the candidate would look like. i‚Äôm basing this off of what i saw in the primaries when bernie was on top for a moment.
chee-lay
standing by
they‚Äôre right centrists are hideous freak like abominations
i want biden to win. i‚Äôm pretty open about that in front of thousands of people everyday. twitter liberals still don‚Äôt believe me because i criticize him. for them it‚Äôs not about just riding w biden, it‚Äôs also about demonstrating fealty. i gotta like it too  
this is the admission that biden has more solid support from the left than bernie would‚Äôve gotten from the center right in the party. if bernies vision of turning out the nonvoters failed like in the primaries, it would‚Äôve been a death blow to leftist momentum
people are going to hate me for this but so many of these liberals would be voting for trump and writing about how the dems forced their hands if bernie was the candidate running against trump rn
what? no it‚Äôs fucking dope
biden is a 5th column shariah democrat, who learned the ways of islam from his best friend, kenyan muslim hussein obama
Okay, for those of you wondering - did Joe Biden really drop an ‚Äúinshallah‚Äù with the appropriate sarcastic usage?
Yes, he did. I confirmed with his campaign - that is indeed what the man said.   
i‚Äôm voting for biden lmao
damn this update is sick  
who tf has maga friends or ones that condemn white supremacists for that matter
Biden  MY SON- 
Trump    
This. This is Donald Trump's America.  
Biden dropped an  Inshallah  at the debate.  
it's very cool that the most powerful seat on the planet is being compared to an among us lobby
i have more live viewers on twitch rn than steven crowder on youtube. get fucked you mug club dorks.
The president was asked point blank to disavow white supremacists.
Here's what he said  
Proud Boys, stand back and stand by, but I'll tell you what, somebody's gotta do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem, this is a left-wing problem.   
wtf is ‚Äústand by because antifa are really violent‚Äù trump supporters od-ing on copium
stand down, stand by because antifa are the real violent ones
trump cannot condemn and ask the white nationalist paramilitaries and proud boys to stand down. he literally justified their existence by talking about how violent antifa is
biden is looking real electable tonight. the way he looks like he's getting rolled over, really makes people feel sympathy for him
he said  how do you feel about black people  trump said  i love the police 
i like that joe and trump's line on cops is verbatim the same.  it's a few bad apples. 
trump literally killed herman cain lol
BIDEN NEEDS TO SLAM TRUMP ABOUT THE ATTACKS ON HIS COLLEGE DEGREE, TRUMP GOT INTO WHARTON W HIS DADDIES MONEY- BIDEN WAS THE FIRST IN HIS FAMILY AND DIDNT GO TO AN IVY. USE THAT LINE YOU OLD FUCK
biden's delivery is incredibly poor, even though the facts are on his side.
joe biden is WAY too passive, trump does a really good job of channeling the anger his base feels. biden's response might seem mature, but this is a failing strategy
Joe call him Jack. call him fat. remember what got you to the dance dumbass
joe is lowkey getting rolled by trump
i do lol, watched the vids yesterday
and we're off to the races. first question is on scotus appointment. trump seems low energy #Debates2020
Hasan now has over 75,000 viewers and is the #1 stream on Twitch all for the presidential debate. xqc streaming too. i am ready chat    
debate coverage has started.   is in the house. come join 60K others  
No Joe, this won‚Äôt help!!!!!  
we've got people - by    
Hasan Piker is already at 33K viewers and the debate hasn't even started. 
If he reaches 50 we've finally hit Tim Pool numbers on the left 
HEY   I'VE HAD NO INTERRUPTIONS OR HICCUPS IN MY BROADCASTS SINCE I SWITCHED OVER. EXCEPT FOR DEBATE DAY TODAY. PLEASE DON'T RUIN MY LIFE BY THROTLING ME ON THIS DAY OF ALL DAYS. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE WHATRE YOU DOING.
hello i'm live and covering the news before the debates later tn! day care is open!  
liberal correspondent   will be joining us with insightful analysis
equinox is open again. testing it out today.
very excited to cover the first presidential debate tonight with the brilliant   tune in at 5 30pm pacific for the debate coverage, or anytime before that for my regular broadcast
i‚Äôve seen that yahya mahamid idf video like 15 times at this point and everytime i watch i think it‚Äôs a meme i can‚Äôt be alone in this
no, it must be the teachers.
love how the govt think that young people become anti-capitalist because of teachers/the curriculum and not because we can't afford to buy a house, we're competing with 200 other people for a job at Tesco  amp; we have increasing access to info that shows us what the rich actually do
How is this at all legal  
watching the jim comey show and it‚Äôs as incredible as i expected
it‚Äôs been two days since he endorsed joe biden and that‚Äôs all i‚Äôve thought about  
i‚Äôm still thinking bout the rocks tiddies
me pls
uhhhh it‚Äôs just for trump supporters. the police have turned into an unaccountable army of libs and they must be disarmed and defunded for uhhh the safety of republicans.  
The long wait is over. We're proud to announce the launch of the Gravel Institute, fighting PragerU on its own turf. Watch this video to find out what we're doing ‚Äì and hear a special surprise.  
liberals get mad when bernie recognizes a joe rogan endorsement without changing a single policy and then literally place republicans on transition teams after securing their endorsements.  
   ‚Äúno fighting!‚Äù 
Thanks for baby sitting us day in, day out.   
i'm platforming the president of the united states, who is live right now.  
ITS MONDAY AND THERE IS SO MUCH NEWS TO COVER OMG GET IN NOW  
my clips channels (not run by me) are absolutely demolishing my actual youtube channel lol  
big week today, found out la gyms are slowly reopening - trumps tax returns show he pays less federal taxes than 17 yo minimum wage workers, and i'll be streaming the first presidential debate tomorrow night between two geriatric assholes
what about when it doesn‚Äôt double?
You can watch me and my audience's live reaction to Trump's Tax Returns being revealed by the NYT  
i‚Äôve been streaming less but have bigger headaches idk why
where. is this out yet. please. where.
hey walt, how bout you suck my dick, old man.
Not a single person is mad at this family picture so conservatives had to start roleplaying in the replies  
my politics  
hey  , i no longer need your help with taxes, apparently you never needed to pay
streamer   paid approximately 33,000 TIMES MORE in taxes than the president did
this is why i am paddy and fredophobic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHY IS NO ONE ASKING ABOUT THE TAXES?!
if liberals run with the  trump's a fake billionaire  angle off the taxes story i will lose my mind.
trump is live after the nyt released he only paid $750 in taxes in 2016-2017  
Tim Pool Removes his Hat (Uncensored)  
i'm live and it's sunday funday  
where are they tho?
there‚Äôs something really weird about celebrity endorsement of presidents that doesn‚Äôt sit right w me. it‚Äôs like a super well produced conversation where the rock almost seemingly has more power than the candidate? does anyone else feel this way? am i alone?
Succession but everyone wants some of Logan's M amp;Ms  
succession is full of freaks. the second season is very good. it‚Äôs exactly how i imagine these families operate.
trump looks like shit today. very bad!
had to interrupt my funday w/ okbuddy to tune into trump announcing amy coney barrett as his scotus pick. a surprise to 0 people.  
hello, the daycare is open. i am live.  
try again sis    
i am very excited to play fredophobia simulator today. mafia remastered is pretty good.
NO POKE DONT DO IT
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAJAHAHAJAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAJAJAHAJAHAHAHAH  
i know candace is black. she‚Äôs using that fact to deflect the valid criticism that she‚Äôs doing racial agitprop for white supremacy. exclusively to make white ppl feel emboldened about their racist beliefs. that‚Äôs my point.
i mean she literally did say hitler wanted to make germany great
candace owens is a white supremacist who uses her black womenhood as a shield, only to make other white people comfortable about their racist opinions. ik i was being edgy w my take. i don‚Äôt dare. there are clearly things you can‚Äôt  amp; shouldn‚Äôt say  amp; i think i was on the line.
no i‚Äôm literally using fake controversy that people want to be mad about to promote a video i made. i am telling you exactly what i‚Äôm doing. i think candace owens is a white supremacist who uses her identity as a shield. this was the point i was making which ppl still agree w.
i very clearly don‚Äôt care
if you didn't like what i had to say about candace owens, you really won't like this video where she lies about breonna taylor not being an emt and acts like she's a drug dealer, all to justify her execution.  
i fell asleep at 11pm on the couch while watching succession last night. my transformation to a boring adult is complete.
lol
Andy Ngo sent my grandma this piece of mail. It‚Äôs kind of hilarious  
i‚Äôm playing italiaphobia simulator ovah heyuh  
ron paul had a stroke and i learned about it from someone posting adam22's video in the group dms wtf is happening
i'm sorry
a man's gotta have a code   
candace owens is just tomi lahren doing blackface
out of 12 witnesses only 1 said they heard the police, the rest of the neighbors said they did not hear the cops announce themselves. on the 911 call walker doesn't know cops shot breonna taylor. they were in plainclothes, bodycams off. no one knew they were cops. #BreonnaTaylor
there is no justice for breonna taylor  
okay it did but only 20%
i ordered postmates and the person recognized me and idk why i couldn‚Äôt tip them in the app and i‚Äôve been thinking about it nonstop for the past hour.
both of my roommates from the past 3 years are now dads. holy shit. i am getting old. how‚Äôd this happen.
trump is live and talking about healthcare which is weird, like he's running for president or something  
The online right is absolutely obsessed with a video of a U-Haul in Louisville, convinced George Soros emptied out his pocketbook for this dastardly $30 rental van.
Absurd engagement numbers on Facebook today.   
i‚Äôm so glad other people think this way as well
Cleanup on aisle Nadler.
i‚Äôm gonna need to see a lot higher numbers zoomers  
	dude !
trump said there will be a peaceful transfer of power post election if they  get rid of all the ballots 
trump is live, let's see what he has to say about the breonna taylor grand jury indictments.  
Some of these tasks are HELL ü§¨ü§¨
#AmongUs 
there are heavily armed 3%s flooding the streets in anticipation of a riot to get more rittenhouse style   legal kills   and these fucking morons are crying about riot shields. 
those are signs. made of canvas. you can literally see the ripples as the wind breezes.  
listening to the kentucy AG daniel cameron (who spoke at the rnc and even mentioned breonna taylor) answer questions about the grand jury indictment in the breonna taylor case. we are now live.  
why do you think they were gearing up for unrest in louisville? the only officer indicted in the #BreonnaTaylor murder was charged for firing into a neighbors apartment, and not for killing breonna taylor in her own apt.
why is qAnon blowing up? I explain why people get sucked into conspiracies  
Firstly, this is my country  amp; I am a member of the House that impeached you.
Secondly, I fled civil war when I was 8. An 8-year-old doesn‚Äôt run a country even though you run our country like one.   
keem, look into lobotomies in the short term, that might also work
absolute subhuman filth.  
this is objectively a good thing. fuck this system and the poll tax these republican sickos put on felons who recently had their right to vote restored w a ballot measure.  
WE MUST FORM A UNION     WE MUST UNIFY  
this is why it's impossible to reason with trump supporters. they say things like  i don't believe in numbers.   
I AM SHOCKED THAT REPUBLICANS WOULD MOVE TO CONFIRM A SCOTUS SEAT SO CLOSE TO THE ELECTION. and other obvious shit i'll be covering today.  
tom you have great hair
i want to have more fun outside like yesterday when i played b-ball w some friends
the fight is lost as soon as you even talk about personal qualities of the appointee. it‚Äôs a stolen seat and qualities shouldn‚Äôt even matter.  
i believe the dems aren‚Äôt conceding to the right enough, this is why mitt romney, a brave american hero, abandoned us. we should actually be more conservative by voting for the cult psycho justice trump appoints. can‚Äôt come across as partisan in these divisive times...
ps5 as well tbh
they suck, so no they wouldn‚Äôt
people keep talking about senate dems threatening to expand the scotus, why leave it at a threat? why not do it?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA MITT ROMNEY HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
still butthurt about tucker carlsons white supremacist writer huh?
how is this dude a killer and still manages to sound like a huge baby  
Streamer boys turned basketball boys üòé  
i am getting better at being an impostor in among us.  
the fundamental nature of the federal government would be rewritten to actually represent the interests of the majority but ofc that's the problem for ben shapiro.  
hey how are you

RBG has passed away. what does this mean for republicans gt;? what will they do?  
i voted for hillary but clearly you people will never learn no matter what the left does or doesn‚Äôt do.
i wake up at  exactly 7 00am every morning. even when i don‚Äôt have an alarm clock. so this morning i forced myself back to sleep. then woke up at 8 00 and 9 00 wtf is wrong w my brain?
i swear this is only cus we look at how stupid republicans are all day  
no.
trump's 1st rally since rbg passed away. it seems very normal and cool  
talking about rbg's passing, her legacy among other news and THEN FUNDAY STARTS EARLY!!!!! join now.  
yo   send me a keyboard pls thanks
my point is we all have privileged blindspots, this is something i talk abt quite often, but that's quite a large one to have as one of the more progressive supreme court justices making profoundly important decisions that impact our lives.
rbg's quote about kaepernick is revealing, not because her immediate reaction was to call kneeling  dumb and stupid,  but because her apology claimed she was  barely aware of the incident or its purpose  this was 3 years after trayvon martin, 2 years after ferguson.
I really appreciate how much Asmongold is open to changing his mind completely on his own over the years.

THAT WAS A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE WTF
maybe liberals will learn their lesson and demand their politicians act like republicans for once. probably not though.
remember when this potato lost despite being a pro trump senator? she‚Äôs on tv all the time despite being this fucking brain dead.  
dems don‚Äôt care abt scotus as much as republicans do
jesus christ
As   just pointed out the people to be calling and emailing right now are Romney, Collins, Murkowski, Grassley. Tell them to uphold the rule that prohibits voting for a Supreme Court Justice 50 days before an election.
literally everyone on the left called this it isn‚Äôt that hot of a take.
love to be a democrat and get absolutely shocked when mitch mcconnel says he'd 100% fill a SCOTUS seat in an election year after not allowing obama to do the same.  its very cool to have alzheimer's as an electorate.
if there is a hell you bet antonin is burning in it  
one fun thing if ginsberg dies will be watching all the bluecheck resistance types going  merrick garland much my good sir  as mcconnell serenely jams through justin walker to take her seat six weeks before the election
we're gonna have the my pillow guy as the next supreme court but at least liberals are getting their thoughts out rn  
i'm doing an emergency pod on rbg's passing.  
rbg passed away. republicans will not honor her dying wish. they will try to appoint another scotus despite blocking obama. please don‚Äôt let this happen.
Dept of Homeland Security's intelligence division identifies white supremacists as the foremost threat to the 2020 elections, per intel assessment leaked to me 
joe biden is delivering one of his best speeches so far taking  a really populist stance, showing his background as a salt of the earth american guy from scranton positioning himself against trump as the real elitist. its really good, that's why you see msnbc criticising it.

Trump got owned by the american people harder than the media ever could at this townhall  
one truly remarkable talking point trump routinely brings up is the obama administration mishandling swine flu. swine flu killed 12,000 americans. this comparison is a faulty one that actually makes trump look worse, and yet he seems to say it because that's how stupid we are.
trump jsut said if we take the blue states out of the corona death count, we'd be doing so much better than the rest of the world. if you vote republican in a blue state you are the biggest cuck on the planet.
trump annouced a last second press conference and it's live now.

Jessica Scarane is at 32,536 votes, 3000 more than Kerri Harris won in 2018. Why'd she lose? Because the total primary vote grew at least 40% from 2018, a record-setting primary year.
For comparison  Just 49,615 Democrats voted, total, in the 2012 Senate primary.

If you‚Äôre a straight guy watching hasan piker streams.      Sus behavior
trump says the marshalls rolling up on the portland shooter and murdering him instead of apprehending him were doing retribution on his request. he also says there will be trucks rolling down the streets as backlash emboldening the white nationalist militias in the country
watching the trump judge jeanine interview where he apparently admits to calling a hit on the portland shooter. i am live and will be doing fun stuff after some brief news coverage.

the french should only be allowed to make movies about police brutality and parkour. nothing else.  
i get that the story is abt how children are oversexualized in western society juxtaposed w the writers repressed culture of forced marriages, but those scenes that reflect the writers experience of being oversexualized are still depicted by children- who are twerking. on screen.

okay i saw enough of the cuties video going around on twitter and i‚Äôm now officially a puritanical anti free speech anti art guy. ew.
The Electoral College allows‚Äîindeed, encourages‚ÄîTrump to ignore California‚Äôs wildfire crisis because he knows he cannot win the state. He doesn‚Äôt even pretend to govern the entire country, just red states and swing states. Those suffering in blue states mean nothing to him.  
	congrats !!!
watching trump's idiotic campaign rally  
new zealand is literally on fire with the chaos, communist south korean leaders informed their citizens and took immediate action and now their countries are on fire with the chaos.
he should resign, pass it on.
i'm so glad that trump didn't tell us about all the information he had about a devastating public health crisis which requires the public to be informed. definitely did a good job on controlling the chaos. we are super not chaotic atm.
i'd legit be worried by qanon supporters spotting that mask

hey maybe the democrats giving money to biden‚Äôs campaign should focus on this stuff instead of getting ready to blame the left for why they lost. most of us are fucking voting biden already. go smile and dial for your carcass of a candidate instead of voteshaming 3rd party voters  
I said I‚Äôm voting Biden against Fascism  amp; for down ballot candidates who support GND, M4A  amp; BLM. After Nov, I will still stand w/ Ryan to form a People‚Äôs Party free from corporate/Wall St ties. Maybe use your shaming energy to phone bank  amp; ask   to update his website(1/6)

it‚Äôs not just about voting for biden now you need to be enthusiastic about it or else you love trump.

i debated michael knowles (bens second in command) on tv last month where he was STILL vehemently against wearing masks. why is ben acting like the right is on board w all the spread mitigation methods all along?

trump is live in florida, and talking about how pure our air is to point out how the fears of climate change are fake. meanwhile half the country is on fire like california or underwater, like louisiana.  
there‚Äôs also an element of injustice that‚Äôs overlooked here. a lot of the big RW media racial agitprop will point to horrific murders where the killer is apprehended and justice is served. but the reason ppl are still protesting breonna taylor‚Äôs death is cus her killers walk free
‚Äúwhat about black and black violence‚Äù is an infantilizing rhetorical question which is loaded with the false assertion that black people don‚Äôt care abt violence they‚Äôre subjected to outside of state sanctioned violence. they do. you‚Äôre the one who isn‚Äôt paying attention.
charlie thinks black people aren‚Äôt constantly fighting against violence in their communities caused by socioeconomic conditions  amp; systemic racism AS WELL AS state sanctioned violence. he thinks they actually LOVE violence when it‚Äôs not cops. incredibly racist  amp; smoothbrained take  
conservatives should just use bing to own the libs imo

i wanna stream making a blade - something similar to forged in the fire. I'm an absolute amateur so have no idea what would be easy to make.
trump is live and talking about america's economic recovery, i'm sure he'll talk about how much he loves vets as well.

Remember when I said this over a year ago and it was treated as a highly controversial statement  
rewatching castlevania
i like that we're now straight up running w/ the insane narrative of crusty anarchists flying around the country to do vandalism as professional rioters. because the president saw a fucking boomer fb meme.
if you fear the tyranny of majority, you are comfortable with the tyranny of minority.  
uh oh after a couple days of 12-13 hour streams my body finally caved and i slept in today.
I've seen enough  Sen. Ed Markey (D) has defeated Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D) in the #MASEN Democratic primary.
i have insane respect for people who wax their bodies now.  
i'm finally watching the insane trump laura ingraham interview.  
the absolute state of libertarians. my man said cops need to arrest demonstrators on his personal suspicions. so much for being anti police state.  
the black pastor trump brought to the kenosha cop meeting just said if good people have nukes then everyone will be safe.
the real outside agitators are usually cops, and white supremacist militias that hate the legitimate grievances that blm protestors make. incredible projection to baselessly claim that antifa are outside agitators when there's no antifa organization.
bill barr is talking about out of town agitators in antifa, which is insane to mention in kenosha, where kyle rittenhouse drove over from illinois and murdered 2 people.
trump is shitting on ending cash bail in ny, claiming its a real killer. reminder that the people incarcerated because they cant make bail are still innocent (until proven guilty) and are held behind bars for being poor. if they're flight risks, or a threat, they don't get bail
trump is standing in front of photos of property damage talking about how awful that is while simultaneously talking about police extra-judiciously killing civilians as collateral damage. this is a great example of the republican opinion on the role of police. property  gt; people
trump is predictably arguing for more support to the police in the aftermath of protests that escalated to property damage, talking about wanting to send in the national guard to kenosha. he claims this will fix the problem like in portland. portland got worse w/ federal presence
bruh, I think I accidently became a turkish resistance figure...  
twitch servers tanked a bit just as i was starting but i'm live and covering the news, including the trump laura ingraham interview and trump talking to cops in kenosha.  
i've purposefully held back from watching the trump laura ingraham conversation because i am saving it for stream.
‚Äúyou look exactly like this‚Äù said the dude using a final fantasy avi.  
hitman 2 is just antifa hitman simulator. the mission i‚Äôm on rn is literally bohemian grove / jeffrey epstein island.
Trump to OANN, in an interview last week, about his news conference strategy   What I do now is, if I don't like a question I'll say,  Thank you very much. Bye bye.' And I leave...What happens then is that everybody gets angry at the reporter that asked that obnoxious question. 
trump is currently defending rolling to a blm protest with paintball guns and mace and spraying people as long as it's a conservative doing it
in the same sentence trump claims, murders are down dramatically in chicago because of him, and also say that murder is up dramatically as a consequence of democratic mayors
trump keeps saying joe biden doesn't criticize the vandalizing when he absolutely does maybe even focuses on it too much. but none of that matters since republicans are going to lie anyway. maybe there's a lesson there, who knows.
i will cross this man into a different dimension  
trump is live, you know what that means.. time to flatten the brain.  
technically no one dies of covid, if they all die from their heart stopping

antifa is literally the field medic that rushes to the body to give first aid and gets pushed off by the victims friend, who is also the same person who yells  we got them right there, we got a couple right here  in the beginning of the video. exact opposite of your assertion.  
my entire house is covered in wax. never again.

here's another post from tucker carlson's dailywire encouraging running over protesters. this one with the openly racist subheader was actually posted by tucker's recently fired writer - blake neff.  
i remember when foxnews and daily caller had to delete their posts encouraging people to drive through protesters. 
for those of you wondering  who  considers running over protesters normal and good, here's a thread of daily caller videos posted on their website celebrating running over protesters.  
btw mowing down crowds in a truck is literally a terrorism tactic recommended by isis, but when white supremacists openly fantasize about it and then engage in it, people consider it normal and good.
tried to make my mom watch it last night and she refused to get through it, said it was too depressing.
too much news going on for a purely funday sunday... however, marco st. marco might be making a return to follow through on a promise i made to my audience.
dark souls 3 was truly an incredible experience.  
for the record i think guns at a protest are a bad idea, regardless of who‚Äôs hands they‚Äôre in. it‚Äôs a chaotic situation. as someone who enjoys shooting guns, i hate how fucking insane everyone in this country is about guns.
just pure evil
There's a clip here of  , who has ALS and speaks via voice assistance, asking Biden about  re-directing  public safety funding. The clip alters the quote. It splices  for police  into it, using Barkan's artificial voice.      
[tires screeching as the right does a sudden u-turn]  
they called kyle rittenhouse a hero for going to a blm protest, scaring ppl w his gun  amp; ultimately murdering ppl. now conservatives mourn the loss of a maga dude who went to portland w bear mace and got killed when he ran after someone w it.  
The funny thing about the looting/rioting debate is that it‚Äôs completely different on here than in real life. At actual protests, organizers do everything they can to keep it from turning into a riot, while the cops often instigate it. 
On here, rioting is unquestionably good. 
Turns out police do know how to de-escalate a dangerous situation.  
welcome to the brain rot
liberals literally do a better job humanizing this gross elitist dang cheeto than his associates and family members promising us how nice he is behind closed doors.  
i'm live and alive, light news - but it's SATURDAY FUNDAY!  
Here is a result that  Kenosha will help Trump win!  pundits  may be surprised by. The NBA boycott/protest/strike around Jacob Blake was very popular.  
barack obama convinced striking players union members who love him to get back to work. wow.  
where are you lifting?
liberals will abandon blm, calling most actions riots very soon, they have already started blaming wisconsin poll numbers on it. they will blame minnesota's shifting poll numbers on it as well.
There‚Äôs a fantasy out there that liberals would suddenly realize ‚Äúcentrists don‚Äôt win‚Äù if Biden lost, but that‚Äôs silly  They‚Äôll point to polls and 2018 results and say they were winning until the looters and rioters moved swing voters back to Trump.
we got 16th place. united we are not fall guys, but tall guys.

i'm live and doing some news coverage then winning the fall guys tournament later with     
and     
republicans are rushing to defend the kenosha shooter. definitely a bad idea.  
‚ÄúPress X to drop crack off in Baltimore‚Äù  
im convinced republicans want to fuck the flag
tom cotton's neck is entirely too long
rudy guiliani said democrats have a  pro criminal agenda 
this is what rudy actually looks like rn  
dana white can only speak in yells
the RNC's last day is live and Trump will be speaking.  
if i can't dome reagan in the next cod it's a wash
watching gamescom rn, but then going immediately into the news!!! I'm live now come join  
btw, i am no way shape or form saying that our current form of police is in any way good. demilitizarion, defunding and legislative accountability is a priority. all so we can have a form of policing that truly serves everyone, rather than serving the interest of capital over ppl
im familiar w the brutal history of police  amp; how they‚Äôre tasked w/ upholding an unjust hierarchy which places capital over the interests of ppl, and that a lot of crime can be solved by focusing on the root causes. i still think some form of policing is a necessity like courts
even anarchist communes in the most utopian sense still need a group of democratically voted individuals tasked w dealing w issues in the cluster which include detainment, harm prevention and solving crimes. i also acknowledge cops routinely fail to do that under capitalism.
same thing happens when cops start knocking on heads rather than letting protests continue peacefully, which escalates every demonstration into violence. if they‚Äôre too busy agitating, they can‚Äôt establish peace  amp; order.
police or some form of policing to uphold a presence of order is a necessity in every society regardless of its economic organization. when cops overpolice or brutalize black communities they fail their duty to protect and serve those communities. there is no order then.
on an unrelated note, i worked out with the olympic bar and weights that arrived yesterday and im feeling good pain again.
when conservatives make arguments like this that change the dynamic of a situation or reach for ridiculous hypotheticals, they're tacitly admitting that the actual events that took place aren't all that defensible.
the 17 year old wasn't protecting HIS property, he traveled across state lines to wisconsin from a border town to  defend other people's property  he doesn't own the firearm legally. but none of that fits your narrative since he was maga and a blue lives matter kid  
this was an opportunity for the 17 yo to put himself in exactly that situation  for ‚Äúthe legal kill.‚Äù he got what he wished for. now people are dead, and republicans are trying to defend him.
conservatives fantasize openly abt carrying a gun w the hopes of using it one day. either at the mythical looter wholl come to your neighborhood post natural disaster, or shooting the rioters attacking small businesses
pre-charlottesville, the meta was running down protestors 
the irony ofc is that the shooter in kenosha who murdered 2  amp; severely injured a 3rd traveled from a border town in illinois to unlawfully carry a gun and brandish  amp; kill- but according to andy the hero who tried to stop him is the real villain cus he has a record.
this dude was a hero. but to a fascist freak who fakes a british accent like andy ngo, he‚Äôs a petty criminal. why? because he the guy he rushed (who had already killed someone at that point) was a blue lives matter kid.  
‚Äúa good guy w a gun‚Äù is just a conservative shooting at black people or whoever the right calls communist or antifa. in every other instance, like people attempting to disarm a shooter w non lethal methods, the good guy is still the shooter as long as hes conservative.
i‚Äôm just trynna make canada great again
the more you look like a thumb the more cop powers you have
the rnc is being insanely boring which is a laughably bad move for them
the rnc night three is back, and i assume it'll be boring but who knows  
FUCK THIS MAN!!!! WE DEMAND CHANGE. SICK OF IT
Kenosha cops can shoot jacob blake in the back 7 times but literally drive away from the militia cosplayer kid running to them with his hands up after killing two people with a rifle, only arresting him today. solid police worküëç  
charlie the shooter was a blue lives matter kid who traveled across state lines to go  defend property  how evil of you to try and spin the blame back to the victims  
i'm live talking about kenosha shootings (shooter apprehended) and much more  
i'm sure there won't be any serious consequences for praising a 17 yo who shot and killed 2 because he  wanted to defend property in another state.  these same ppl defend cops for shooting an unarmed person 7 times in the back point blank, and then cry abt property damage
i'm partially fearful the dems won't be able to win those suburban voters and lose others (and the race) in their efforts to win the suburbs, but i'm also fearful that they will court them successfully, solidifying the reality that the dems are not for the working class.
i hate that american politics is basically two parties laser focusing on wedge issues, as they try to court the same mostly white upper middle class suburban voters as the plurality of eligible voters simply don't vote.
western civilization acts advanced but all they know is getting owned by disease, not using bidets, colonizing but not using the spices and lie.
me, but i‚Äôm actually good at video games
republicans are insane but at least their early speakers know how to party  
love this braindead yuri bezmenov meme that‚Äôs getting popular again after cod cold war, cus the 1st stage states that our nation which finds single payer healthcare too radical, has an entire generation of people supposedly indoctrinated into marxism. so where are the marxists?  
powerful take
illegal immigrants coming over the southern border into canada !
every early speaker on the rnc kicks off the night w statements like ‚Äúi smelled abortions‚Äù and by the end of the night the messages are indistinguishable from dnc speeches + school choice. not looking good for the republicans.
Didn‚Äôt she used to sell that Wap?  
melania's speech is insanely boring, someone needs to play music like the oscars
As Pam Bondi accuses the Bidens of nepotism, note the GOP speaker lineup beneath her.  
its cus they love immigrants duh, they'll even break the law to naturalize some (on camera at the rnc)
eric trump is just starving for his fathers attention
nice of trump to let tiffany trump get airtime
i know what abortion smells like 
technically a lobsterman is also a big beautiful boater
rand paul attacked biden on the crime bill, and also his vote on the iraq war... from the rnc podium?
can't believe republicans are engaging in cancel culture, trump must step in and defend free speech !  
THE RNC NIGHT TWO IS BACK BAYBEEEEE, these republicans cancelled a brave qanon speaker 20 mins before the show and IM PISSSSSSEEEDDDD  
i'm live doing a recap of the insane rnc 1st night and other big  stories.  
the only demographic that matters is tiktok influencers (only ppl who make that kind of money at 22)
trump messaging is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think about the pandemic but instead of how good things were right before it.‚Äù idk how well that‚Äôll work for the people living through the pandemic atm. it‚Äôs like a coach talking about how they were leading by 20 points in the 1st half. you‚Äôre losing atm
a bop
I wanna be at the RNC!  
how bout i do whatever i wanna do on my twitch channel where i stream over 9-10 hours of content a day
uh oh.
you know i‚Äôm KEKW all day
Let‚Äôs settle this once and for all
my name is hasan piker and i came here from turkey, both of my parents are turkish if i called myself brown would you do a double take?
donald trump jr. is literally teary-eyed talking about how joe biden wants to silence conservatives
i'm sorry but if nikki haley is brown then i'm brown too
the most interesting part about all the criticisms against what's happening  right now  from the rnc speakers are basically admitting that trump wasn't good enough to fix anything, and made everything much worse
did kimberly guilfoyle just say she's a 1st gen immigrant from puerto rico?
A big swing from Vernon Jones here  Arguing that a Democratic ticket with a Howard graduate won‚Äôt deliver for HBCUs.
lmao this psycho had bone cancer and lucked out w an experimental treatment so now the nhs is bad? wtf ahlakjpaksjdaslksajulkdajsd
republicans are also going with the  mourner in chief  narrative, which i assume is the product of some dc consultants who thought 170k americans have died so i'm sure this will be relatable to some families
its wild that half the rnc speakers so far have had covid, partially because they literally just refuse to wear masks, but also because they're trying to signal that people recover perfectly post covid to hammer the  covid isn't that big a deal  narrative
my woke king charlie kirk is opening the rnc calling trump a bodyguard and also defender of western civilization
watching RNC now, and it's being streamed at 4fps on the main gop youtube/twitch channels  
yes. but also trump is still president tho. so he still is responsible. sorry.
lmao as tho virtually anyone cares about the truth on either side man cmon
biden should plainly state trump has blood on his hands w/ corona more often, because the counter from trump will always hurt him as it'll remind people of the deathcount, and openly force trump to continue shirking responsibility. because he IS responsible.
i'm live and talking about the insane amount of news that came out, including the first rnc day inc.  
They're gonna #BernieBro Ed Markey while at the same time actively celebrating and elevating the #khive. The moral and ethical flexibility at work here here is almost impressive.  
netflix really messed up with the marketing of this movie  
ben shabino streams now    
did u actually do this i‚Äôm confused
yeah ive met some weird people    
i can‚Äôt believe this happened
hello i'm live, its sunday so it's all FUNDAY. mandatory fun. react content. maybe a bit of poltics, just a tiny bit  
peep the hat!  
this is the single most polarizing topic i've ever had to speak about in my community. eggs and the best ways to consume them.  
i'm down to hang btw
when you have the power of allah and anime on your side  
i do !
i one tapped a banana tree earlier w a katana and it‚Äôs truly an insanely rewarding experience.  
where are the fun sickos these are the boring ones üòî
many of you know i‚Äôm v excited for this. this lineup is mid at tho. diamond and silk got robbed.  
what did this dude do? i legitimately have no idea and his apology left me more confused than i was before
streamers have active youtube accs. some literally started on youtube then moved over to twitch and vice versa. this notion that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúconflict‚Äù is idiotic.  
?
well sucks, cus that means you get him too bitch
liberals who spend their entire time trying to find bernie or busters  amp; nonvoters so they can shame them, rather than rationally sell them biden and getting trump out of office are 100% doing a disservice to democrats and should probably gtfo of my mentions
EGG TIER LIST ONCE AND FOR ALL TO END THIS TALK ABOUT WEIRDOS WHO PREFER OMELETS (EW)  
literally the most true thing anyone has ever said
Omelettes are a bottom tier breakfast and honestly I don‚Äôt know why more people don‚Äôt speak openly about this.
Every Finish Line in Fall Guys  
i make tim the tatman look like the shroud of fall guys
hello home gym people! you were very helpful in helping me get some rogue fitness bumper weights! now my question is, how will I find a solid reliable bench, maybe even a squat rack.

wife swap is anti white agitprop
i'm live and talking about the grilling the postmaster general is getting abt disrupting usps  
i would rather you do this kind of light hearted fun trolling than cancel culture drama shit every day of the week keemstar.
They think ( amp; hope) the fight for Medicare For All died with Bernie‚Äôs campaign. There is no reason to stop the struggle, before and after the election, no matter who wins  
dnc day 4 recap. liberals should hold joe biden to the promises he made early on. i want him to win and i'm still worried.  
wait am i reading this wrong? he was 12 when he did this?
healthcare is economic policy. this is joe bidens own fucking healthcare proposal. i'm asking him to  set up a strong offense by mentioning  his own healthcare policy. in the middle of a fucking pandemic. please step into traffic.
wow you don't think the dnc defeated racism, you must want trump to win. i for one think they did end racism :)
i will never understand the liberal expectation that we can just shame the non voters in a country where the majority of eligible voters don‚Äôt vote. just cus i see how bad things are doesn‚Äôt mean others will care. esp when the numbers show that more ppl don‚Äôt.
voting isn‚Äôt easy for a lot of people. they work, they think their votes don‚Äôt matter - you have to sell them on why they should vote for you, beyond the moral imperative of getting trump out of office. don‚Äôt expect ppl to brave covid  amp; wait in lines w/o giving them sm in return
republicans always fear monger and then offer something to their base trump did racial agitation, tied immigration back to jobs  amp; security. millions of ppl believe him. we can‚Äôt just say we‚Äôre gonna do unity, civility empathy, point to how bad things are, and hope for the best
We must totally dismantle ICE and establish a pathway to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants in our country.
THE PUBLIC OPTION IS BIDEN / OBAMAS OG PROPOSAL AND DOESNT GET RID OF THAT YOU FUCKING TROGLODYTE
here are some liberals responding to me for asking biden to promote HIS OWN healthcare policy. not bernies. his own healthcare policy that obama tried to pass in 2009. i support biden over trump btw. i want him to beat trump.  
do you think the public option bernies proposal?
holy fuck, they literally mentioned the public option ONCE in passing this entire convention  amp; only talked about defending ACA- this sucks insane amounts of ass. these freaks are literally relying on how awful trump is to etch out a marginal win. it's a gamble that failed in 2016
we need more hunter biden
hunter biden is proof that crack can't be all that bad
this seems cool and normal  
cory booker just asked why his gf (rosario dawson) likes bernie more than him.
seeing julia louis dreyfus make these incredibly cringe jokes is ruining veep for me. just get the same writers to write the takes
yang gang is back baby
last night of the DNC, malarkey inc  
he should've said  in a videogame 
now that cenk is cancelled for a completely reasonable take on 8/20 that republicans lost their shit over, i think he should come on my stream where i ask him to apologize.  
trump keeps talking about a surge of covid-19 cases in new zealand. while it's true that there's a surge it's adjusted to the remarkable way they've dealt with it so far. 2 days ago their reported number of active covid-19 cases was 90. Nine-Zero.  amp; Trump keeps calling it a surge
trump is live and talking about how much the democrats hate the cops in front of optimus prime  
Pelosi endorsing Kennedy is just evidence that supports   case against dynasty and smoke filled rooms anointing candidates. Bold prediction  it will backfire. Markey‚Äôs up two. My guess is now he‚Äôll win the race by more than 5.  
 happy 8/20 poopoo, i made you a samurai and gave you your eboy haircut
if this is on stream, peepoHey chat   
yes as everyone knows, i am a huge fan of the clintons, you really got me here
steve bannon is being prosecuted as a political criminal for doing what every republican has done before him and continue to do so. stealing money from old racists thru fearmongering is a proud tradition. what's next? are we prosecuting charlie kirk 
for tpusa? shame! 
No one gets to complain about primary challenges again. ü§ó
So  , when can we expect you to reverse your blacklist policy against primary orgs?
Because between this  amp; lack of care around  ‚Äôs challenger, it seems like less a policy and more a cherry-picking activity.   
i have of course started stream at the usual hour that i do, and twitch is completely broken.
exactly one year ago i said some things on a broadcast that got me a swift cancellation from the right. today, steve bannon gets actually cancelled by the govt. i'm live.  
obama really knows how to sell neoliberalism, w/ light leftwing populism.  
you are absolutely insane but i‚Äôm still glad we have maga level fandom on the blue side. just shut the fuck up and vote okay ?
people constantly come into my chat and tell me i'm hurting the democratic party w/ my critiques, but absolutely no body could do hurt the party better than its top policymakers
coup detat
democrats should run on unity, civility, doing more efficient coups and of course, the deficit. this seems like a good idea.
this pandemic caused every famous person to just go visit texas and arizona i have no idea why
obama really is good at selling a marginally better concession-prone alternative to the horrific  immoral vultures of the republican party.
i was wrong it was just about small business owners. i was confused because the person introducing the video talked about bringing back to supply chain to the us, and worker protections.
the dnc video montage about building back better immediately starts with fucking small business owners
having hillary clinton talk at the dnc isn't for biden, it's for hillary clinton- at the expense of biden.
hillary is live and looking like a real slay queen
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti disconnected utility service at the Hollywood Hills home of TikTok star Bryce Hall ‚Äî which has been the site of several large parties in  flagrant violation  of COVID-19 public health orders.  
THE DNC IS BACK FOR MORE BAYBEEEEE!!!!  
holy fuck trump gave qanon material for 70 years
So   how are you going to fix the incredible amount of damage and misinformation that you are now responsible for?
Because a 1 15am tweet to slip under the radar after blowing up a totally false and divisive narrative across networks isn‚Äôt it.   
talking about how the liberal media outlets misrepresented AOC for following convention protocol last night and other news.  
why do i seek it out so hard
i am reading as well as watching but the old anime is so insanely well done. so were the movies.
anyone who says they like berserk technically have watched hentai
weird flex  
i‚Äôm not kidding when i say this is fucking incredible content. i really hope diamond and silk are performing as well.  
Donald Trump's approval rating is 42% rn, that's only 3 points lower than Obama at this time in his presidency. His approval rating in the Republican party is 90%. do not buy into this narrative that there's a significant amount of nevertrump republicans we have won over.
once. he mentioned it once in passing. i have serious concern that they won‚Äôt push for it. redditors love to revel in hasan hate even when i‚Äôm making concessions and asking the dems to push for the public option which joe ran on.
This is the looting you won't see on the nightly news.  
i literally complained that the public option was only mentioned once and all were talking about instead is how many times joes family members died. i wanna win. we‚Äôre running 2016 plays again.
well i answered his question and he seemed happy with it but, here despite the fact that you already admitted youre ignoring the point i‚Äôm making, i‚Äôll send the drawing one more time üòä  
a shame the crayon didn‚Äôt work. i didn‚Äôt say ONLY mention public option. i said only mention public option ONCE. as in i want them to run w that more  amp; have messaging for the republican counters against it.
i mentioned this in my coverage tn as well- it‚Äôs not about the immediate audience watching. it‚Äôs more of a signal of what the party platform will look like + how dems are going to market themselves this cycle. i don‚Äôt want a repeat of 2016  amp; what i‚Äôve seen so far worries me
here. i‚Äôll hold your hand. the highlighted part is your answer. also since you missed the main point twice, i‚Äôll draw around that w a red crayon for you.  
you‚Äôre asking a question i already answered.
w/o a leader the left can only focus on downballot races and organizing. i don‚Äôt think the democratic party will magically adopt m4a. but im very worried they‚Äôll get bullied out of pushing for the public option even. they should be preparing for countermessaging already
idk seems like a good policy that should be a part of the big tent in the democratic party. they had ady on who‚Äôs spent his last years on this earth fighting for m4a, so it‚Äôs not that wild of an expectation imo. only mentioning public option once is the real criticism here though
You waited several hours to correct your obvious and blatantly misleading tweet.
It sparked an enormous amount of hatred and vitriol,  amp; now the misinfo you created is circulating on other networks.
All to generate hate-clicks from a pre-recorded, routine procedural motion.   
just a couple of blue check liberals having fun online  
i really didn't think the democrats could come up with a worse message than  it's her time  and now we have.
mention of joe biden's family dying  12983102938120938 
mention of m4a  0 
mention of public option  1 
liberals make it so hard to vote democrat holy shit.
People are attacking Congresswoman   because she had the formal role of nominating Senator   so he could receive his delegates and transfer them to Vice President  . Please understand the process before attacking her or Senator Bernie Sanders.  
this is such scummy clickbait,   endorsed Bernie as a part of protocol. i get #resistance twitter not knowing better, but MSNBC is 100% confusing people deliberately.  
bro the democratic party healthcare position literally is defend the aca + lower pharma prices (a thing that trump is running on as well)
i'm incredibly sussed that there is very little mention of the public option, actually none at all so far. if dems abandon even that and run the  defend ACA  line i will lose my fucking mind.
calamari comeback state
i mean i hate trump so idk what this is supposed to prove? like is the argument that they're both friends w/ epstein? if so, how is that an own?
just dont have him speak, i don't get why bill clinton's hollowed out corpse HAS to speak at the DNC
interesting choice having jeffrey epstein and ghislaine maxwell's friend bill clinton speak at the dnc while the rest of the party is calling trump a rapist.
joe biden is a great mourner, he called me when a close friend of my was suicided tragically a few months ago.  -bill clinton, probably
dnc day 2 is already wild  
New image of Bill Clinton getting a massage from Epstein victim Chauntae Davis during the infamous 2002 trip to Africa with JE, Maxwell, Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey  
if nancy pelosi is socialist, and funding social security and medicare is socialist. then democrats either have to completely drop the act that they care abt these programs at all and stop running to the left at all- or start addressing this red scare fear mongering.
trump routinely calls biden a socialist, perhaps the dems would do better trying to address why this fear mongering is silly instead of conceding to the  socialism is bad  boogeyman. that is ofc, if they want to still use defending social safety nets in their campaign messaging.
donald trump just said  joe biden wants something more than socialism, he wants to turn this country into venezuela   
hilarious that the people who coined the term  virtue signaling  are acting like donald trump gives a single shit about women because he symbolically pardoned susan b anthony. conservatives are now more whiney than the libs they once  owned. 
let there be light!!!! I have power and able stream now!    
i was gonna look at so much okbuddy today to make up for not browsing it the past two days üòî
virtually zero incentive by most utility providers to ever make improvements on aging infrastructure to keep up w additional power needs during a heat wave is one reason.
LOVE TO LIVE IN THE DEVELOPING NATION OF LOS ANGELES WHERE THE HEAT CAUSES ELECTRICITY TO GO OUT. THIS IS A VERY NORMAL THING. I FEEL LIKE IM BACK IN MY CHILDHOOD DAYS IN TURKEY.
okay, im back! recapping DNC night one, talking about restricting people's right to vote and talking about being on the h3h3 podcast. join now!!!!  
lmao i started my stream and lost electricity. wtf.
here's my live reaction to the cringe festival also known as the democratic national convention.  
i don‚Äôt get it, are you actually offended by this or doing the conservative thing where you fake being offended?
come on the show hasan.  
Bernie's been busy. Before and after.  
bernie really is looking good tho, keep it up king.
okay so did cuomo.  
bernie is the first person who directly mentioned policy differences between biden and trump instead of vague calls of unity.
bernies got a lot of a wood. not like you didn‚Äôt know this already.
watching bernie at the dnc is cuck porn
gonna vote for joe biden cus the guy who got owned by trump said the dems won‚Äôt do a ‚Äúhard left turn‚Äù
this dude got to speak with joe biden at the dnc along with eric garner's mother.  
joe biden knows how to mourn so fucking hard, he's literally the best at grieving, please vote for him - he will attend your funeral
lol  
the dnc is literally just republican light so far
how tf does the democratic party have so many hollywood liberals and they still can't throw an interesting event. esp when all the event planners are free cus covid killed the live events industry
August 13, 1996  Gov. Christine Todd Whitman (NJ), Rep. John Kasich (OH) and Rep. Susan Molinari (NY) all address the Republican National Convention in San Diego  
i'm watching the first night of the DNC right now. come join  
would love to find out a single  radical leftist policy  that's responsible for why these  democrat run cities  are having a homelessness crisis. is an unchecked housing market with significantly more vacant properties than homeless people a consequence of radical leftist policy?
trump keeps talking about shutting our borders to immigrants who were going to bring in coronavirus. mentions halting the h1b visa program. ofc he never mentions the carve out for migrant worker programs because our entire agricultural production relies on exploiting img labor
?????
perhaps the dems should stop spending so much time attacking socdems like bernie who just want better social safety nets, since that only serves to legitimize the right's  radical left  narrative. that is of course, if democrats still want to act like they care abt these programs
the post office is not supposed to be for profit. if it was for profit, republicans in rural areas would not get their medication delivered. those routes aren't profitable.
americans (who aren't big businesses) who cheer on deregulation because they are  job killing  are perma-cucked.
perhaps democrats should stop trying to show how much they hate the left and instead address why these attacks of radicalism are idiotic, since they're going to call dems marxist communists anyway. just ask why it's so bad
donald trump keeps claiming that the dude who openly stated he'd veto m4a in a hypothetical where it would pass the senate and house of representatives is a puppet to leftist radicals. does a single person believe this? are trump supporters really this stupid?
i'm live and it's DNC time, jack! Lots of news to cover including Trump closing in on Biden's lead.  
if only there was a himbo w a passion for dark souls games who‚Äôs been calling this for weeks now...  
uh oh. don‚Äôt do it jake. u don‚Äôt want the perma mald. it‚Äôs hard to shake off.

Something I just keeping back to over and over is the tremendous continuity between the last two Republican presidents, both of whom left the country in ruins, amidst historic catastrophes. The entire party and movement are rotten to the core and unfit to govern.
these people are psychotic and disgusting. they are literally turning into the meme that reactionaries claim liberals are like when they try to weaponize social justice for political capital.  
i'm live and we're watching fun videos, it's sunday FUNday  
looking forward to hearing about every dimension of joe biden's political worldview at the convention  
sunday morning talk shows are garbage, so we made a better one and it's called POWER REPORT.
it's a sunday show for the capital-L-Left, with voices that reflect the diversity of the movement and the role of people-first power in society.

its so good that it's making me rewatch berserk, which is also very good.
that person who wrote the ‚Äúcancel genghiz khan‚Äù thread being rabidly against muslims in india in present day made things a lot funnier tbh
Trump wants to destroy the USPS, out of fears of mail-in ballot voting. his supporters living in rural areas will suffer the most without the postal service.   
i'm constantly thinking about dark souls 3
77% of cops voted for mitt romney in 2012. 84% said they voted for trump in 2016. cops are republicans.

love to go on the   website periodically to look at barbells and weights that look to be in stock, but are never actually in stock when i try to check out. i do this once a week. it's a great exercise. where can i find weights and barbells? pls help.
ü¶™ apple ... what is this ?
i cannot get over the fact that trump openly admitted that he doesn't want to fund the usps because he doesn't want people to mail their votes. additionally insane that most rural areas with republican voters NEED the usps to get ANY mail.
hello i'm live and there's a lot of news to cover. watching kamala's first interview w msnbc and going over the alex morse story and trump admitting the wants to mess up the usps to halt mail in ballot voting.

trump is claiming that joe biden wants to  fling open our borders so that people with coronavirus can come in.  to do what exactly? crowdsource their healthcare on gofundme like the rest of us? maybe he means they wanna pass thru the us to sneak into canada.
I am live and so is Trump to tell us about how Joe Biden wants to kill god or something idk  
everytime i get into a battle this happens now.  
here's how i feel about kamala harris as joe bidens vp pick  
i didn't even loot, he just invaded when i was embered (i think he invaded in a pvp area) forced the items into my inventory, as soon as i noticed it I alt+f4ed but it was too late. i'm like 12 hours into the game too so I def don't want to restart. so shitty
a random hacker basically bricked my save file for dark souls 3 by invading me and giving me a bunch of undroppable items - i signed on earlier to play offline and now it keeps spamming the images of the items on screen. i wonder why people do this stuff.
i think trump thinks these tests are killing people
joe biden and kamala harris are now live and on the podium holding their first event together.  
Watched   last week for the first time in a long time. He‚Äôs totally SHOT, looks terrible, exhausted, gaunt, and weak. If there was ever a good reason for no shutdown, check out this jerk. He never had much going for him, but whatever he did have is missing in action!
copmala vp, cringe liberal humor and all other kinds of news. we are now live! join  
i am not exactly the intellectual titan, nor an astute art critic. but ben shabino is super wrong about women's sexuality in art. even art created with the express purpose of making money.  
‚ÄúBro no‚Äù
‚ÄúNo choice but to stan‚Äù   
thinking about the time jpegmafia and i talked about kamala  
watched midsommar last night. not surprised with what i saw, as i knew the swedish were strange people. they eat kebab pizza.
kamala harris is the best possible person for the ticket, exclusively because of how deranged the kh*ve is, and it'll be very entertaining to watch them go at it with the equally deranged qAnon weirdos
trump is live and will likely talk about copmala. let's see what choice words he's got for her.  
Kamala is a perfect VP  someone you were told you were excited for but had to drop out of the primary before voting even began due to lack of interest, but not before morally castigating the guy who picked her and then backtracking
i'm live and talking about the DNC speakers shouts out to andrew yang, who got tossed aside like a used napkin. come join now!  
i welcome the return of the second best gamer on the platform after myself  
masks can give you headaches!  i debated a buncha republicans alongside twitch streamers on the   show, the show formerly known as rajj royale.   
idk what this says about my brain but last night i dreamt of joe biden reading an english translated chinese quran at a campaign event, and he just couldn‚Äôt read at all.
to be fair if any woman got wet near ben shabino, they probably do need medical care.  
republican‚Äôs current election strategy is ‚Äúdemocrat run cities are in disarray‚Äù meanwhile they run the country.
turns out a business plan and even moving isn't enough to escape the tyranny of spectrum throttling. love to see it folks.
Trump has been pulled out of the press conference abruptly, shots were fired near at 17th and Penn, secret service is rendering aid to someone who's been hurt. Trump is now back at the briefing
trump just got pulled out of the press conference by secret service  
promises made, promises kept. i will now chug the thicc water on stream to complete the first half of my promise.  
Ben Shapiro‚Äôs opinion on WAP  
is twitch prime dead? that and many other news, as monday starts  
as a gamer american i do not fear this change.  
i took some photos yesterday and i literally just look like dogshit. a daily feeling.
one that doesn‚Äôt have the problem you‚Äôre having
just turn it on again LOL
this is an extremely niche tweet
luther getting knocked out in season 2 episode 3 and then golden brown playing is a direct nod to guy ritchie
Swedish meatballs are actually based on a recipe King Charles XII brought home from Turkey in the early 18th century. Let's stick to the facts!

i‚Äôve never eaten there nor do i have a hollywood fix interview :(
umbrella academy season 2 has started off great.
finished full metal alchemist brotherhood and man it's a great anime, but the ending made me so sad
where is this.
i am literally the worst gamer on the platform so this is a horrible standard to set.
i'm absolutely shaking at the idea that people are subscribing to pokimane, she doesn't even react hard enough. literally pissing and shitting my pants over it.

americans are the most cucked nation. especially republicans who make less than 250K a year who then vote for a dude who's talking about additional cuts on the capital gains tax.
this absolute psychopath is cutting the most significant funding vehicle for social security and medicare during a global pandemic eviscerating the older population.  
if walls don't work, why do we have them around bathroom stalls type beat  
trump is still claiming that the negotiations are sullied by democrats  who are trying to bail out blue states,  you know - those states where american citizens live, a significant number of them who even vote for republicans.
watching the trump presser (potential Executive Order incoming) before going on the Austin Show  
i am live before the austin show talking about trump's potential EO later today and what the negotiations look like for additional unemployment spending.  
UPDATE  ICYMI,    will be on the   Royale, formerly known as the Rajj Royale, today at 4 PM EST/ 1 PM PST! Hope to see you all there!  
people have to recognize at this point that pepe isn't a hate symbol. there's an entire doc about the creators battles against the altright called feelsgoodman. it might have been coopted at a certain point by /pol but it's not 2016 anymore.  
Hasan pay me in shingles for this new fancam  
hasL here! My Twitch name is StephenBaggett I'll be right back! I gotta go get food. Thanks for playing with your community  lt;3  
unbelievably stupid that republicans are celebrating pre-existing condition coverage, after 12 years of shitting on the ACA which is how it became the law. it's expected, but the fact that they think you're too dumb to recognize it says alot abt how dumb they think rep voters are
Every time Elon Musk pokes fun at government assistance for the 99%, remember that he would be worth nothing without $4.9 billion in corporate welfare. Oh, Elon just l-o-v-e-s corporate socialism for himself, rugged capitalism for everyone else.    
trump is live from his golf course in nj. brain flattens.  
i'm now live.
i am obviously watching the dr disrespect livestream atm, will go live in 5 mins  
started dark souls 3 on stream yesterday. fromsoftware games take the concept of easter eggs and turn it into the only mechanism the plot is delivered through. as someone with a permanent looter brain, it really appeals to me.
hey siri, which president created ICE?  
yo wtf this is why i lose my mind. cus these mfs just straight up lie in my replies to my fans.
y‚Äôall literally started calling him dobby and a house slave because he wouldn‚Äôt go along w the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs use him to fuck hasan‚Äù mission. you reached out to all my editors for dirt and got nothing. and yet you still just lie about this shit everyday.
idk maybe cus debatelords like you will use the confusion in perpetuity to attack me and he felt bad about it?
this isn‚Äôt a controversy you fucking moron.
 1- this person still edits for me.
2- he works on his own volition whenever he wants to make vids and gets paid per vid
3- literally apologized and deleted those tweets but you screenshotted them to make a point
4- bought him a new pc for no reason. it wasn‚Äôt payment you fuck. 
im paying them in shingles
all my editors have family members kidnapped by me. that‚Äôs why they work for free ofc.
it‚Äôs an easy gotcha even if it‚Äôs not true. that‚Äôs how memes turn into reality by repetition.
lol one time i paid an editor w rocks.  
woke up randomly, can‚Äôt go back to sleep and the only thing i am thinking of is how unhealthy streaming has made me. i really have to cut back the 11 hour streams and maybe even take a day off and definitely start working out daily.
currently, 280K people (including me) are watching an animated wallpaper stream as donations and memberships pour in to the dr disrespect return stream.   is also here.  
i'm keeping an eye on the doctor disrespect stream but can't watch on twitch due to TOS stopping me from featuring a banned streamer prominently on my stream even if it's newsworthy. will post if there's new information.
sources at Facebook Gaming and YouTube tell me DrDisrespect has not and will not be offered a partnership with either company at this time, but is free to go live just as any other creator would
crash bandicoot is a furry game and so many people refuse to admit this #stateofplay
watching the Playstation event because everyone will kill me if i don't.  
i'm live and trying to figure out if dr disrespect is returning to livestreaming on youtube, and many more news stories.  
trump and his surrogates have gone from claiming  mail-in ballots are bad  to,  it's ok when i do it  to  it's okay only when red states do it.   
i like that while my shingles pain luckily went away, now i got lower back pain. being 29 is awesome. not going to the gym is awesome.
is this pro corbyn? i‚Äôm leaning pro

BREAKING  Blizzard staff are compiling a list of workplace requests for management including equal pay, fair promotions, and living wages for QA. The US games industry has no unions -- this is one of the largest collective labor actions in games to date  
Trump is live, he actually has 2 very good executive orders, and is making concessions with the dems on evictions and an extension on additional unemployment benefits.  
10 min interruption to put in a business plan, will be back asap.
what happened to dr disrespect.
this isn‚Äôt me.  
A video with 25k likes on  ehouse (on tik tok) got taken down because this lady filed a copyright claim. She‚Äôs mad we made fun of her boyfriend ü§°ü§°ü§°    
i reacted to trump's absolutely insane baby brain interview on hbo.  
i like that trump's new take is that only red states should be able to do vote by mail.
trump is claiming that beirut was an attack. he just doubled down when asked to clarify and said it looked like a bomb
trump is live on fox business before he goes live at the white house to flatten our brains considerably.  
talking about the beirut explosion, and trump's insane interview. i'm live, join!!!  
I explore the incredibly cringe phenomena of liberal tiktok stars and try to understand why they're viral.  
A video I received on WhatsApp of the scalr of explosion in #Beirut, confirming it was at the port.  
trump's literal response to a thousand people dying a day from coronavirus on the axios interview was  it is what it is  i imagine the benghazi crowd won't make a big stink about this line.
watching trump on axios  
trump routinely claimed he wouldn't touch medicare and medicaid during his 2016 run, and then immediately moved to repeal obamacare. i worry that this is a similar empty promise.
trump allowing states to purchase drugs from other countries actually doesn't seem that bad. it's likely yet another fake left populist move to improve his approval rating for november.  
new apartment, and my electricity is back but spectrum is throttling my upload speeds! had a great two days with them but I guess that honey moon is over! nice!
DHS is gathering intelligence on activists in an attempt to tie them to foreign militant groups, per intel report leaked to me.

finally doing the second round of pobox now!!!!!  
I AM LIVE (on stolen electricity, but live nonetheless)  
here's yet another big fuck you from american political figures to the working class - $600 extra relief is over for now.  
this person literally thinks i make 500k a month can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôre actually children or completely brain dead. or a braindead child maybe.
yeah that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm mad i didn‚Äôt stream for one day cus i‚Äôm going to go broke now.
ma≈üallah is how you spell it in turkish
masallah
truly a wild change of events when spectrum is the only thing working in the new apt.
yo i really do hate how much access people have to my life and they can just say idiotic shit like this even when i got no power and i‚Äôm still trynna find a way to fucking put a stream up.  
i am literally on my neighbors electricity. the stolen wifi meme is real. will try to stream today!
background music absolutely slaps
actually a solid move imo
Trump is banning Twitch also. He watched Hasan
yup, the emergency outage line told me i will not have power until monday
HELLO   I HAVEN'T EVEN MOVED INTO MY APT YET AND YALL CUT MY ELECTRICITY PLS RESPOND!!!!!
congress gets paid 174K a year to tell workers they don't deserve 600$ extra for the duration of this pandemic with a gigantic eviction crisis looming. we're now live.  
millions of americans get legal documents delivered through the mail, but voting is where we draw the line because of potential mail fraud?  
i was so excited to find out that i can order weights and a rack from rogue fitness - but it has the worst ui, and doesn't let you know that virtually everything is out of stock.
legitimately confused how alyssa milano reached the impressive podcast numbers of ‚Äúone third rogan‚Äù this isn‚Äôt a meme. that‚Äôs alot of people.
Children locked in cages, the scourge of white supremacy, a podcast more popular than your own. 
Everywhere, injustice reigns.   
LOL landlords are trying to get into the New Orleans courthouse so they can evict people during a pandemic but these protesters won't let them.  
from anti maskers wearing nazi masks to Australian Karen's anti maskers are all over the place.  
congress will vote later today on  's amendment to block the US military from recruiting kids on Twitch
'whats your favorite w4r cr1me' has a chance to be in the history books 
the same people who don‚Äôt think fauci is credible after dedicating most of his life to epidemiology are now mad we don‚Äôt wanna believe the ramblings of a doctor who thinks demon sperm exists.
It's not a coincidence that   has the smartest thinking on Coronavirus recovery plans and has been in the lead on taking on #bigtech. The will to govern AND a detailed knowledge of commerce is *critical* in building a just society.  
dude if you die because you went to a trump rally that is really sad, i can't even make a joke about that. herman cain died of coronavirus at the age of 74 because he went to the trump rally in tulsa.
america loves coups so much, seems like we‚Äôre gonna bring one home from work one day  
is this dude actually taking credit for white supremacists going to jail after a deadly nazi rally that one of their nazi contributors organized? it‚Äôs like commending hitler for killing hitler.  
the same people who don‚Äôt think fauci is credible after dedicating most of his life to epidemiology are now mad we don‚Äôt wanna believe the ramblings of a doctor who thinks demon sperm exists.
i‚Äôve been playing god of war side quests like a mf off stream, i can‚Äôt believe i never finished this game.

looking good step bro üò≥
at least he‚Äôs committed to the bit  
joseph kony also thinks this is great  
TWO OUTAGES IN A ROW WOWOWOW. ITS A RECORD NOW.
it‚Äôs not.
LOST MY INTERNET WHILE ON A CALL W SPECTRUM DOES IT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS.
no you need to be a medical expert to disprove that. also the irony is this idiot is defending someone who is not even qualified to make statements on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19. they‚Äôre simply a dr, not a researcher studying the subject.
wish he cared about molestation of students as much as he did about  cancel culture 
jim jordan just name dropped bari weiss and then asked if the tech ceos are concerned about cancel culture
matt gaetz has talked about ben carson being placed on the extremist watchlist of the splc 4 times so far. they placed him on there for his views on gay marriage and then apologized for it.
back in 2015. 
yikes
what a silly take. i don't even disagree with temporary UBI nor do i with increasing wages for everyone. this was the final concession that was deemed appropriate at the time (i think workers deserve much more). however, discontinuing it is just plain cruel.
conservatives love talking about diversity of opinion while crying that tech executives have a different political opinion than them.
its remarkable that these people are getting paid $174K a year with our money to tell us, we can't have $600 extra dollars a week during a pandemic that has unemployed 40 million americans.  
congress is now asking about twitch dmca process. kelly armstrong cited small musicians and their cease and desists. most artists I've seen literally whitelist streams when asked and it's the record labels that spam dmca's.
you cannot make this shit up  
W
PLAYBOOK PM  After we reported that   was positive, we got an email from a Gohmert aide.  
facebook has worked with the daily caller (which has employed white supremacists) as a fact checker, but clearly even THAT is not enough for republican representatives in terms of  diversity of opinion 
literally twitch.  
here you have a boomer failing to  recognize that boomer is a state of mind and pattern of behavior, rather than the actual generation.  
so far not a single congressperson has asked jeff bezos why dr disrespect was banned. this is a miscarriage of justice.
my petition to make gunkata an official martial art in the ufc is being silenced by big tech sjw ceos
the ranking subcommittee member on antitrust law is currently talking about how competition doesn't help the consumer.
the bar is really low tbh, partially because these tech monopolies are demonstrably predatory, and also because the dems aren't asking questions like  why are my grandkids no longer emailing me?  or  how do i download pdf? 
you know i criticize dems like crazy but it seems like they are the only people here who actually legitimately care about amazon's predatory practices that identify and destroy competitive retailers.
jim jordan is now wilding out.
jim jordan is now asking if google is going tailor it's features to help joe biden's campaign. it's either deliberately open ended to have a gotcha or coming from a person who simply does not understand how political advertising works.
he literally doesn‚Äôt even understand that his campaign emails are different than his personal email account. this person isn‚Äôt capable of representing anyone.
he's now engaging in the classic trope that conservatives are being silenced and his emails are getting sent to junkmail. he's literally asking the google ceo to do tech support for him.
rep greg steube is now talking about google silencing the gatewaypundit, an openly far right conspiracy website that spreads misinformation. he's using an anecdote about not being able to reach the conspiracy website in the search results in a congressional hearing. i want to die
oh god my isp is acting up again. what a wonderfully ironic situation that i'm getting throttled by spectrum during my coverage of a congressional hearing on the power of internet monopolies
this actually explains why this meeting is all over the place. it was ofc deliberate.    
having amazon, google, facebook and apple at the same hearing for antitrust is like having the steel industry and hollywood at the same antitrust committee hearing
perhaps the best representation that our politicians are completely oblivious to internet problems is having a meeting on online competition and inviting amazon, facebook, alphabet (google), and apple to the same meeting. these are entirely separate industries w/ some overlap
the democrats certainly have more validity to their claims abt social media causing division (regardless of their hyperfocus on russia) hate speech and misinformation is a HUGE problem on these platforms. regardless, this is the government using  trust busting  to threaten corps
this entire house hearings going to be democrats crying abt russian election meddling through social media , and republicans crying about chinese cooperation  amp;  that these  sjw billionaires  are stopping conservative speech. they dont care abt trustbusting.
time and time again people like tim pool have exposed themselves as grifters, yet their platform grows with each falsehood creating an even larger audience of braindead boomers who can't parse through misinformation.
the doctor literally thinks demon sperm gives you ovarian cancer and does christian prayer healing sessions against witchcraft. she's going against the empirical evidence mounting against hydroxychloroquine using anecdotes. I thought the centrists loved facts and logic?  
watching my megabillionaire boss jeff bezos testify before the house that he certainly doesn't have a m*nopoly. watch live with us now!  
his name is   he‚Äôs running a gofundme to retain a lawyer.    
this is why i said lefties in red states are troops. this dude literally puts his life in jeopardy just to exercise his first amendment rights #blm   
no wonder cops and cop lovers don't know what a tampon looks like
i for one, am SHOCKED!!!!!!  
yes, acknowledging palestinians as humans is anti-semitism
seth rogen must be protected at all costs  
does this dude think there aren‚Äôt turkish jews ?
 Why are we still here? Just to suffer?   
The things that come off okbuddyhasan are amazing!     
trump is now claiming that the doctor who promoted hydroxychloroquine was a very good doctor. she promotes christian prayer to dispel witchcraft on her youtube page.
trump is still pushing hydroxychloroquine.  it's safe, it doesn't cause problems, i took it. 
trump is live with an impromptu presser. here we go. time to flatten out your brains.  
THIS OUTAGE WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY SPECTRUM WHICH STILL HASNT EVEN GIVEN ME A CALL BACK TO UPGRADE TO A BUSINESS PLAN.

attorneys general hate this one trick to stop federal agents from being in harms way... pulling them out.

i reluctantly have to continue using spectrum, and am trying to switch over to the business account but i can't even do that as they've put me on hold. i can't even give them more money for their failures.

What a hypocrite. Elon Musk has received billions in corporate welfare from U.S. taxpayers. Now he wants to stop 30 million Americans who lost jobs from receiving $600 a week in unemployment benefits, while his wealth has gone up by $46.7 billion over the past 4 months. Pathetic.

this was the greatest moment of my streaming career  
hey is the hasanabi broadcast peaking at 17K concurrents? time to shut it down momentarily, and for no reason whatsoever.
does this mean no stream today ?
trump keeps comparing us to other countries that have flattened the curve in the first wave when mentioning reopening the schools and we are no where near that reality. i understand how important it is to reopen schools but w/ the ways things are going for the us, it's insane.
the mayor of portland is also the police commissioner and has played a significant role in fucking up portland activists
covering the dersch and creeping fascism in the us, then the joe biden obambe video and more. so much news!!! join.  
CBP has deployed 2,174 personnel, 46 aircraft and 2 drones to assist dozens of police departments across the country since June, per CBP document leaked to me.

the best part is when you realize he's just naming things around him  
my man lives like a capitalist everyday!  
i love matt taibbi but holy shit dude we get it cancel culture bad.
can't believe i am seeing this but joe rogan and jamie actually exposed   for distorting the kaepernick kneeling controversy. look at his face!!
me and   have been calling this out for years!!!! even rogan can smell the grift now   
trump is justifying using his gestapo paramilitary in chicago and albuquerque by claiming it's cities run by democrats that have a crime problem. doing a Q and A now.  
wild to me that joe rogan is lowkey dunking on ben shabino on the issue of colin kaepernick
joe rogan had ben shabino on his podcast so you know what i'm gonna be doing until the rona taskforce today  
new  sources tell me due to recent media coverage of fake giveaways and potentially unconstitutional bans, the US Army esports team has paused social activity, streaming on Twitch, and official activations with Twitch including participating in upcoming Twitch Rivals events

i would never watch 90 day fiance unless it was with 11,000 other people.
truly shocked on the lack of ghislaine maxwell coverage since trump ‚Äúwished her well.‚Äù her being ghislaine maxwell - who helped execute one of the most prolific sex trafficking rings for the wealthy and was sued for trafficking a minor to prince andrew.
it‚Äôs good for me but not necessarily for the overwhelming majority of people brother.

trump's corona taskforce is back, since we're hitting new records with coronavirus. let the brain flattening commence!  
my broadcast is postponed until 12pm and i am hosting   on twitch in honor of their michael brooks remembrance broadcast. will start at 12pm pacific.
i gotta stop tweeting reviews of games on the pooper i said compelling like 12 times
but having said all that it's still so much fucking fun. the combat REALLY improves once you get better at the game and also once your character learns all the stances. with one notable exception. the fucking camera. maybe the devs wanted this to be too much like a miyazaki game
its not like anime dialogue is exactly top notch either, but at least animes make up for that with compelling and unique characters. the main character in ghost is 1 dimensional as hell, which i'd be fine with if the side characters carried - but they absolutely do not.
the landscape is stunning-i found myself riding around for hours looking for hotsprings, chasing birds and foxes into shrines and clearing out mongol camps. unfortunately some of the side quests aren't as compelling as that. the dialogue is so bad i thought it was deliberate
ghosts of tsushima takes the best mechanics of every open world/ adventure game of the past decade  amp; plasters it onto an impossibly pretty canvas. the game however is far from perfect. while making an ambitious tribute to japanese culture devs forgot to make compelling characters
michael brooks was a brilliant, funny and supremely empathetic person. my condolences to his family and coworkers. a huge loss.
The Tucker Carlson thing is an obvious lie designed to win sympathy  amp; distract from the actual news that broke today that Carlson was accused of harassment. It's a classic Trump tactic.  
This year I met this young American, a journalist, who turned out to be a friend, who I thought that we would meet again. How is it possible? My heart and prayers go to his family and friends. May his passion for social justice be remembered and inspire people around the world.

trump's worst interview to date where he got owned by fox news multiple times.  
i am absolutely loving  ghost of tsushima, been playing like crazy like off stream. but since i'm on the last main mission before the 3rd act map I don't want to spoil it, so i'm holding off on passing that on stream - it is however very hard to edge myself this way.
when will the government realize that you radicalize people when you beat them up for protesting.

trump mentioning enthusiasm numbers in his base vs. the lack of enthusiasm in biden base is a HUGE self own, because it shows how horribly he's mismanaged every situation. so much so that he's lost the incumbents advantage and people are rallying against him.
this is literally the chad meme i refuse to believe it‚Äôs a real person.
I SWEAR TO GOD I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ENEMIES AT SPECTRUM THAT WAIT FOR MY STREAM TO HIT PEAK NUMBERS TO SHUT MY INTERNET OFF PLEASE STOP DOING THIS SPECTRUM!!!!!! STREAM IS BACK NOW  
can't wait for qanon to start calling chris wallace a pedophile now since he's shamed donald trump.
they keep muting trump, this is insane
this is why the hogs are so dumb, because they get emboldened by their hog president  
chris wallace is correcting trump on the spot in this interview including the part where trump flat out lies about the biden-bernie plan which he claims  wants to defund the police 
why is trump so sweaty? I have so many questions
why did chris wallace do a more contentious interview on fox news w/ trump then half the msm outlets that have been able to speak to him ?
watching the trump interview w/ wallace LIVE rn.  
ben shabino wins in the marketplace of ideas by relying on the stupidity of his audience.  
ok sunday is funday but i can‚Äôt wait to watch this trump interview w wallace today.

i love that this isn‚Äôt a parody.  
holy shit

every libertarian that claimed to arm against a tyrannical overreaching police state is currently cheering on portland protesters getting randomly kidnapped by unmarket feds w/ military equipment, for the crime of graffiti.   
HAHAHAHAHAHA here's thomas chatterton williams, the main drafter of the harper's letter, saying he didn't have glenn greenwald sign it because he was  outvoted on that . HAHAHAHA they  cancelled  glenn in the anti- cancel culture  letter. LMAO you really can't make this shit up  
also i play games like a boomer, constantly running in circles searching every corner for loot and trying to get as close to full completion before getting bored. this unfortunately doesn‚Äôt make for compelling entertainment.
for those who don‚Äôt understand twitch culture there‚Äôs still a solid 6k ppl who wanna watch me play games and then another 6k who don‚Äôt. i don‚Äôt wanna punish the ppl who legit wanna watch me play (hence why ppl make sock accs for lowkey game time without trolls bothering you)
the wind guiding mechanic is also a swing and a miss imo, i get it it's a pretty game and they wanted to make guiding system pretty as well, but it fails to do what it's supposed to so many times, which is to guide.
my immediate problems w the game so far have been the 1d boring main character  amp; rather dull side characters (except strawmen) japanese vo low key changed that for me. I still wish there was a lock on targeting system, it's nuts that you have to control the camera in battle.
i've been playing ghosts of tsushima offstream (just side quests/ exploration)
-i see why streamers have alt accs now, i worry too much abt being entertaining when i stream
-the side quests are getting more fun as i progress
-japanese dub unironically made the game better

i just saw the video and i‚Äôve never been more threatened or upset since i started on twitch.
henry cavill back off morherfucker this is my himbo safe space.
btw i mentioned this multiple times on stream but if you think these ideas are anywhere near as impactful on policy as white supremacy has been you are completely insane.
im sorry but this is the funniest possible quote dr disrespect could‚Äôve given on what is clearly a very serious matter otherwise. my man literally was pushing david icke right before he got permad.

trump is doing a better job campaigning for biden than biden is ngl
trump is just wildin out now talking about how his travel bans stopped terrorists coming from  jihadists regions  from coming in and blowing up our big beautiful cities.
trump is now using this press conference to directly attack the biden speech from earlier today about his renewable energy initiatives
this press conference has been the most explicit campaign rally i've ever seen from trump, he has spent most of it attacking biden. trump probably does not like the polls.
trump is now talking about how biden had 8 years to solve americas problems, despite being the president for the past 4 and not recognizing that this criticism can easily extend to him.
trump is doing an impromptu press conference on china. what will he say? time to find out.

tucker carlson is at it again lying about masks, and masking off with white nationalist lines  
ive had this issue for 4-5 days now and its only getting worse, so no.
lets be real it's prolly a pinched nerve/ muscle fatigue induced sprain i sit in front of two monitors for 12 hours a day and even tho i stretch alot it's still not enough. standing hasn't solved it either. gotta re-center my monitors probably.
i'm not a big hypochondriac and usually just take a  wait and stretch it out  approach to my pain, but recently i have had insane neck pain that has now turned into ear pain and even my scalp hurts on the right side. i am beginning to worry.
i love when conspiracy theories go apeshit like believing that people are buying actual sex slaves on the cheap furniture website

the most effective way to limit abortions is thru sex education and access to contraceptives. conservatives happen to hate both while simultaneously talking about how abortions should be illegal.

sure ask the creators they put it on r/okbuddyhasan
hey guys i changed my youtube banner, check it out :)  
in honor of my exploitative capitalist practices, i will start my okbuddyhasan react stream earlier than usual. for those ootl, this is a subreddit of free memes that my community makes for me to look at and they've all been coerced to make these memes  
the nra gun karens are especially great in this one.  
i‚Äôm gonna keep posting banners over nuclear takes    
lmao i have $6 million ?! I MADE IT BOYS !!!!!!!!!
this is dope as hell!
uh oh.
all memes are entitled for compensation you have nothing to lose but your chains shitposters.  
‚Äúi can‚Äôt believe a leftist streamer reads a whole ass subreddit of fan made meme content. memes are just a way for this capitalist dog to exploit his fans for content. going forward he should pay for each meme that someone makes. marx would never stand for this.‚Äù  
here‚Äôs another top contender.    
here‚Äôs another banner submission    
don‚Äôt
drawing was the most important part of my life until college. i‚Äôm not trying to undermine artists  amp; their work. it‚Äôs super valuable. but if you‚Äôre gonna fucking get upset that i wanted to put a fan made meme banner on my yt front page u can suck my dick
just want people to understand how fucking stupid some on the left are. this is the reality. they don‚Äôt know what the fuck is happening. they just think they‚Äôre blasting a good take. maybe they‚Äôre miserable just like we all are and this is their outlet to feel less so.
this is very likely the banner i‚Äôm going to use.    
hello. if you‚Äôre a pro illustrator please don‚Äôt join this contest. it‚Äôs for amateurs. there you go. problem solved.
yah like all the racists anti vaxxers and bigots make me super mad because they‚Äôre right. good call. the more mad i get, the more right they are. or maybe i get mad because this shit makes ‚Äúthe left‚Äù look like out of touch kill joy morons.
if you're a leftist on the internet and think the LTV applies for a fucking meme banner contest log off and never log back on again. it's anprim time for you. you are a fucking joke  amp; not a single person outside of your splinter discord group takes you seriously.
lol i don't give a fuck abt my youtube banner and while someone was shitting on it yest i thought it'd be cool to put something a fan made on there instead. so I said i'd give the winner 100$ and VIP in chat. now people are talking about how that's exploitative of fans ü§Æü§Æ

trump is now claiming that the radical left dislike mlk's values?
i am very interested to find out if trumps culture war gambit pays off. he's signaling to cancel culture, but i wonder if it's a decent enough distraction from the dire economic situation that alot of americans are experiencing atm

trump said it's cancel culture to want to take down confederate monuments

as coronavirus numbers explode, americans have decided that wearing a mask is now a culture war issue because we are the dumbest nation on the planet.  
thanks will look at this today
i just want joe biden to at least lie to me like obama did but he won‚Äôt even do that.
virtually every single video i upload on youtube is deemed not suitable for all audiences. but then again, i still don't know who   pays out because I can't change anything on adsense. also please give my 100k button.  
i can‚Äôt shut the fuck up tbh.
i try to end stream around 10-11pm after 12 hours with the hopes that i can go to sleep at a reasonable hour and then lay in bed in the dark for 4 more hours looking at tweets while half paying attention to a netflix show. every. single. night.
As mayor, I support everyone's right to protest the District Attorney I endorsed.  
reporting that the eurovision netflix show is actually funny and good also i love rachel mcadams
i like my aeron herman miller but it‚Äôs pricey
Starting to realize that Elon Musk is a megachurch pastor for atheists
Liz, the male host of true Anon and Matt Christman I believe will be on this in 10 minutes to discuss current Affairs  
We miss you already, Reckful. It was an honor to know you. Our community isn‚Äôt the same without you, and we‚Äôre all better for having had you in our lives.
.  is an excellent reporter. Even if she wasn‚Äôt, she shouldn‚Äôt face harassment for her work. Beyond that though, too often when people who are outspoken or ‚Äúpolarizing‚Äù on Twitter get harassed or threatened other media colleagues stay silent - that needs to change
i'm live and talking about the news. including ghislaine maxwell.  
RIP Reckful
I hope this will be a wakeup call to everyone who creates a reward structure around ridiculing and mocking mental illness
We can be better as a community and we will be better. 
Reckful's passing has been confirmed by his roommate. Byron was 31.  
no ice played all the bioshock games. and all the uncharted ones, except for the 4th one.
this sounds awful, so yes.
the wildest part of this video is the fact that the lady w the camera is not running away.   
i started it on stream cus the turkish dude was a national embarrassment. turns out he had the most functioning relationship after seeing how some of these other ones play out.
bio shock is an incredible game. i‚Äôm just pissed it crashed and wiped out a whole level of worth of saves for me. should‚Äôve been manually saving relentlessly i guess. new games have made me forget abt obsessive saving. uncharted 2 however, has the clunkiest mechanics.
we watch entire relationships on my stream for hours. i love how fucking awful it is.
this entire show is always like this. literally every dude they find is always exaggerating the laws or straight up lying.
they can't all be 10/10 posts im live 11-13 hours a day
not enough ppl are talking about how awful space force (the netflix show) is. it shouldve been carried w the  cast alone.
this is a weird thing but i love laying across my bed. that is all.
BREAKING  Hasan says that  Lebron is a much better athlete than Ronaldo.  Pisses off all the Eu frogs in chat!
thank you bioshock remastered for making a buggy piece of shit. after playing uncharted 2 and quitting right at the end, i am convinced that we shouldn't play older games to keep those memories intact rather than destroy them
my unobtainable lifelong dream is to marry ivanka trump
live, and alive. covering the news for today.  
dan crenshaw had a really odd tv appereance  
lol. shut up bitch.  
all the corporate lobbyists too. fuck it throw every politician in the pit as well.
i wish we could jail every executive at every isp.
i fantasize about a future where i don‚Äôt have to use   as a provider. it‚Äôs a fantasy world where i actually get good internet service.
think i might be done for the day.
my internet is completely gone.

covering adult news, will get the twitch stuff in a bit.  
i ran two audience polls at two different times and found out what the average hasanabi watcher looks like. the answer may shock you!  
apparently charity streams are yet another paid opportunity i wasn‚Äôt aware of on the platform üòî it does make sense tho, it‚Äôs like built in marketing for the charity that doubles as a fundraiser.

imagining a guy unloading chests of opium in Canton in 1836 being like  I am so sorry. 1% of the sales of this opium will go to elevating Chinese voices. I am seriously not racist. I love Chinese people. The East India Company is working tirelessly to center colonized bodies. 
playing uncharted 2 !!!! since i loved the other naughty dog game, tlou2  
Wanna feel old?  
am i not allowed to cover trump news now ? i'm so confused.  
talking about corona cases spiking, the twitch banning of donald trump  
Keemstar has been falsely accusing and harassing a woman for 3 years regarding DrDisrespect. Keemstar does no original reporting, has no sources, and speculates on fake bullshit. don't listen to Keemstar. doc's tweet does not refute what i have reported

Last of Us 3  
What is best in life? To tuck a salmon golf shirt into dockers, carry an AR-15 like Elmer Fudd, and threaten to murder people to defend my Cheesecake Factory-ass house.  
insane how people will defend a random man on the internet they've never met and act like they know him better than the people he lived with
playing bioshock. in ancap paradise  
watching the new sascha baron cohen 3%er rally video and its 100% y'allqaeda
In 2016 a kid obsessed with Hitler and white supremacy opened fire on a McDonalds in Munich, killing nine people and injuring dozens more. He bragged about having the same birthday as Hitler and called himself Aryan.
He was of Iranian descent and was the son of Shia Muslims.   
currently downloading uncharted the nathan drake collection and i realized i don't think i ever played uncharted 4. guess its time to play it all on stream.
we‚Äôll be talking about the villages today.
white on white crime üòî  
it‚Äôs incredible that the story made me despise the truly unlikable character abby (we called her gun girl and booboo bennett) and then warm up to her and even love her by the end. that‚Äôs good story telling. she showed growth. a lot of it. it was good. also she‚Äôs literally joel.
now ima say spoilers
the last of us 2 was awesome. incredible mechanics, one of the most beautiful games ever made, and hours of murder poetry. this game made killing too fun. 
pacing was a bit off at times,  amp; i wish ellie had a more fruitful development but overall the story was good as well. 8.5/10 
Maybe this is an unpopular opinion but I think removing episodes with offensive content from availability is protecting the brand more than any kind of progress. The episodes should stay up and audiences should evaluate those shows accordingly.
One more time--it takes over a century for a saguaro to grow  arms.   This cactus that was just destroyed for the border wall may be older than the border itself.  
this is the worst take on this platform.
if you have a breathing problem (as most karen‚Äôs falsely claim to avoid wearing masks) it‚Äôs even more reason to wear a mask. this video also does a good job showing why it‚Äôs nonsensical to claim you can‚Äôt wear a mask because of breathing problems.  
the more mainstream twitch becomes the more the brain cancer spreads to all the people who have been asking me wtf i‚Äôve been doing for the last two years. once my normie friends are saying pogchamp it‚Äôs game over.
i've rewatched the last 8 mins of dr disrespects last stream approximately 10 times. it's very weird.
back to playing last of us 2 around 70% of the game is now complete  
if you have an intact foreskin thats a form of privilege and we dont talk about that enough. uncut men dont reply to this, its time to step aside for a bit and let circumcised voices be heard
he smuggled too much shungite  
Texas congressman ‚Äî¬†who criticized local officials for covid ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äù two weeks ago ‚Äî¬†hasn‚Äôt tweeted about coronavirus in a week as Texas hospitals say they‚Äôre dangerously swamped.  
Admittedly, almost every other time I've said  I screamed  I did not actually scream, but today, reader, I screamed  
This is what it feels like when you see a dick scroll by in twitch chat.  
you‚Äôll be shocked to find out that ‚Äúhe admitted it‚Äù in THREE whole books!!! all the way back when you were doing epic bacon posts in internet message boards.
controversial take but if you‚Äôve demonstrated that videos you made 9 years ago don‚Äôt represent your worldview anymore- then people who throw that back at your face even after you had hid those vids are not doing it out of care for progress. they‚Äôre just assholes.
people don‚Äôt know who the fuck wendell potter is. remarkable how shitty the comments are. maybe you should google him before you start yelling at an exec who quit and has been fighting against this shit for decades before you call him a pos.  
this trump hannity in interview is absolutely insane - he's rambling about hillary clinton and fox anchors. straight up old guy shit.
5g, coronavirus conspiracies- pizzagate revival and many more news.  
I sympathize with their complaints but this rowdy threatening behavior solves nothing. The way to make their voices heard is at the ballot box.  
biden should make cary fiorina vp proving that italians are in fact poc.
i watched the platform yesterday and it‚Äôs beautifully shot and acted and a cool story but a little on the nose. def would recommend tho.
Something weird going on here. Karlos goes from being a vocal conservative conservative who does interviews where he justifies Philando Castile‚Äôs murder to ‚ÄúWypipo_h8‚Äù and posting this video?  
i felt exactly the same way when i found out about spine cooling
i am the same way as this except without the sex having.  
Democrats be like ‚ÄúI hear you, and I understand why you‚Äôre upset. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to do nothing to address your concerns. The orange man is bad, and you have nowhere else to go. Now, would you like a hug? No free healthcare but we offer free hugs here ü•∫‚Äù
the fbi actually likes her because they‚Äôre gay.
the admission of ‚Äútwitch made me mega horny by having women on the gaming platform‚Äù is also a tragic but a very real argument that people make on a regular basis.
here is the article which contains the lawsuit. this has to be a meme.  
some dude  is suing twitch for 25 million dollars because,     [twitch] continues to expose viewers who just want to see people playing video games on Twitch, but instead get exposed to sexually addictive material and content on a consistent and regular basis daily. 
lowkey pissed that i wasn't added on to the sexually suggestive twitch streamers lawsuit i really need to hit the gym harder and start posting thirst traps on ig again üòî
why are people mad at bubba wallace, who isn‚Äôt even the person who found the ‚Äúnoose?‚Äù are his takes about racism now invalid because someone else saw what they thought was a noose  amp; reported it? also are we acting like nascar fans weren‚Äôt losing it  over the confederate flag ban?
I‚Äôm a Black man raised by a single mother in a housing project. That story doesn‚Äôt usually end in Congress. 
But today, that 11-year old boy beaten by police is about to be your Representative.
I can't wait to get to DC and cause problems for those maintaining the status quo.   
a lot of people have been shitting on the last of us 2, but this is what it truly reminds me of.  
is that why he refused to prosecute him for the war crimes ? ‚Äúwe must look forward‚Äù makes a lot more sense now.  
reminder that the cbc, hillary clinton, and chuck schumer endorsed engel.
establishment democrats suck so much ass
covering the primaries. AOC won hers and Jamal Bowman could win his against Engel. very cool!  
The people want to vote.  
i'm playing in a cod tournament full of cod pros and my team is a league semi-pro ( ) and a league pro ( ) this should go well.  
i will also not stream for #twitchblackout tomorrow.  
trump's talking in arizona about our strong border wall, and he talked about undocumented border crossings decreasing by 84%, i wonder if there's a global pandemic that could perhaps factor into that? who knows.  
here's most of my coverage about police brutality and blm over the years, every single thing i wrote about and said 4 years ago still apply today.  
a turk moment
I am the king of himbos  
oh fuck oh shit oh fuck  
Facebook is making Mixer partners sign an NDA to enter the Facebook Gaming partner program  
the blue check is coming from inside the house!!!  
Sources  Facebook offered an insane offer at almost double for the original Mixer contracts of Ninja and Shroud but Loaded/Ninja/Shroud said no and forced Mixer to buy them out. Ninja made ~$30M from Mixer, and Shroud made ~$10M
Ninja and Shroud are now free agents 
watching trump supporters is my favorite activity. especially these guys from tulsa who were some of the most weeblike trump fans.  
even the confederacy had a longer lifespan than mixer
talking to   about the Mixer news now.  
White Supremacists literally have spies in the Pentagon and we‚Äôre still worrying about people stealing from Target  
MIXER IS DOWN FOLKS, talking about that and others news right now!    
UNACCEPTABLE. I STAND IN SOLIDARITY W MY GREEK BROTHER AS AN ENTHUSIAST OF DINERS
so it‚Äôs either shit he admits (soy) or things he‚Äôs actively agitating against (iran), or shit he‚Äôs obv in support of- this dude ran on the muslim ban as a platform and has his own concentration camps here in our front yard.
the high level criticisms so far are  trump dropped an investigation into turkey helping iran subvert american sanctions on iran, asking china to buy soy (which he openly admits at rallies),  and saying that he loves chinese concentration camps on muslims, which is unsurprising.
every time i hear bolton speak about trump it‚Äôs some shit like ‚Äúhe was worried like a little school girl about a summit being cancelled. instead of immediately glassing north korea. not presidential!‚Äù i obv hate trump but bolton is a genocidal maniac lol
The rich continue to get much richer while workers suffer. Since the pandemic started, 643 billionaires have seen their wealth go up by $584 billion, while U.S. households have seen their wealth go down by $6.5 trillion and nearly 46 million have filed for unemployment.
omg   played stay gold by #bts on their broadcast today. incredible stuff.
lol. i literally got suspended from twitch because of the right wing not liking ‚Äúmuh free speech.‚Äù
ight i‚Äôm no longer playing with you old man. no free clout. go back writing articles at townhall for 8 people about how you should be able to say the n word without any consequence or whatever you‚Äôre trying to advocate for here.
okay thanks for conceding that it‚Äôs an insanely stupid thing to jail someone for flag burning. glad to see that you were merely pretending to be a moron in your original tweet where you said it was okay cus the left wants it.
you were literally making an argument to jail someone for free speech, by claiming it‚Äôs ok cus the left wants it. then you tried to compare it to losing a job, and now you‚Äôre backtracking. jesus christ i‚Äôm not even smart. i‚Äôm an internet himbo and you still can‚Äôt keep up.
point me to a single time you‚Äôve had free speech at your work place? it‚Äôs almost like work places are not democraticly organized (still wouldn‚Äôt be a given if this was the case btw) you‚Äôve never had free speech at your workplace, and now you want to take it from the government.  
i like that you‚Äôre still trying to make an argument for jailing someone for free speech (literal flag burning) do you think because you‚Äôre not a blue haired sjw that people won‚Äôt notice that you‚Äôre still making an argument for this? ones a business firing someone, not the govt.
we're back playing the sjw vidya game and it's great so far. join now!  
yes, trying to burn down a gay nightclub by lighting their pride flag on fire is the same as burning an american flag that you own.   
nope. still a bad idea. nice try though.  
losing your job = going to jail. very smart.  
this dude hates the constitution and free speech.  
watching this dude who wore a pig suit to a pro cop rally in boston, and i'm shocked how awful these people are treating the same cops they're supposedly in support of  
y‚Äôall look at what this girl from nyu created     
She‚Äôs black. She‚Äôs Muslim. She‚Äôs a refugee. He‚Äôs never gonna leave her alone.  
i had a dream last night where someone fucked my hair up and then i woke up and realized that someone was me, and it‚Äôs real life.
While the right whines and cries about  free speech  because they're not getting enough likes on their Facebook memes, jackbooted thugs drag a woman away from the president's rally because her shirt expresses a different viewpoint.  
Actually you just got ROCKED by teens on TikTok who flooded the Trump campaign w/ fake ticket reservations  amp; tricked you into believing a million people wanted your white supremacist open mic enough to pack an arena during COVID
Shout out to Zoomers. Y‚Äôall make me so proud. ‚ò∫Ô∏è   
trump just proposed legislation that will jail americans for one year if they burn an american flag
america deserved trump as president
trump is riffing about his rail incident at west point for approx 15 minutes now
trump just admitted to asking to slow down the coronavirus testing because the numbers are too high
trump has started speaking at the rally.  
C O P E  
eric trump always looks so wet and gross. really sad state of affairs when you're worse than donald trump jr. no crowd work skills. lara trump looks disappointed in him.
the trump rally is literally empty, it's wild how hard the tiktok zoomers owned the trump campaign.
protestors  are tiktok zoomers who all signed up with numerous accounts  
Kentucky has used Covid-19 as an excuse to slash polling places for Tuesday‚Äôs vital primary to defeat #MitchMcConnell. There were 3500+. Now, there are 200. 
Jefferson County, where half the Black voters are, will have 1 polling place for 610,000+ voters.
POGGERS
Idk looks like a suicide to me  
eric trump just posted a qanon photo and i'm losing my mind. also, looking at all the extremely smart trump supporters ready for the tulsa rally  
At the Trump rally, Brian Clothier, 61, is wearing an adult diaper over his pants that reads ‚ÄúScientists say [farts] spread the virus. I COVID my ass to stop the spread.‚Äù  
covering the trump tulsa rally today and excited to put a dent in the last of us 2! been thinking about the game when im not playing, a good sign that i‚Äôm hooked.
my man with the snitch tag
kora seasons ranked 3-1-2(1st avatar sequence)-4-2 (the rest of season 2)
hey dumbass. the game came out 7 years ago. maybe that‚Äôs why ‚Äúi played it off stream.‚Äù    
lol this ain‚Äôt twitch chat you don‚Äôt wanna bait like this on twitter people will legit come after you without realizing you‚Äôre meming
to be fair i‚Äôm like 4 hours in so there‚Äôs a lot more game to potentially disappoint me but i think it‚Äôs great so far.
i did you fucking moron.
lmao the games been out for 24 hours and so many people have been malding - at least i‚Äôm admitting that i haven‚Äôt finished it but it‚Äôs actually really good thus far. meanwhile most people who are crying haven‚Äôt even touched it and have maybe watched streamers play it.  
the last of us 2 has been really good so far idk why everyone‚Äôs bugging and yes i played through the first big event and while it‚Äôs anticlimactic it‚Äôs not worth the outrage i‚Äôve seen.
finally playing the violent sjw game that got every nerd on the internet riled up. it's the last of us time. let's see if it sucks.  
talking about juneteenth, aoc's race and all the news!!!!! join now!  
NEW  Major corporations are bankrolling police foundations across the U.S., helping them to buy surveillance tech, body armor and weaponry.

i officially am incapable of working out consecutively. in a tremendous amount of pain. might be getting old, and the quarantine owned me.
Did y‚Äôall notice how looting died down and peaceful protests continued, but the media coverage of the protests has died down? This speaks volumes to the media‚Äôs part in demonizing the black community.
yes
it's already 11 so i think i'm gonna start last of us tomorrow. sorry for ending early, but it really took a long ass time to put the desk together. (currently typing this while standing up)
idk how many hours it took to finally put together the standing desk, but i finally have a desk that can stand. it's also alot larger than my previous desk so it can hold alot more diet mountain dews on it.
absolutely ridiculous  
trump just aired an ad where osama bin laden endorses joe biden
trump is currently extremely triggered about players hypothetically kneeling for the anthem on a livestream hosted by his failson, which is called triggered.  
downloaded the last of us 2, really loved the first game and apparently this one  very political  - also a lot of you asked so it's happening later today and tomorrow :)
everybody laughed when black isrealites were the first to say bethoven was black üòî
Alright folks strap in and strap up  
Four months before he was killed by Atlanta police, Rayshard Brooks was interviewed about his experience on probation.
Please listen to him.
#JusticeForRayshardBrooks   
the   is also responsible for the first attack ad against bernie and tried calling him an antisemite. they're insanely scummy. the democratic party is so pathetic  
steven crowder thinks the death counts by covid-19 are inflated. how did all these additional deaths happen?  
Remembering all the cops who didn‚Äôt get their McMuffins on time  
talking ACAB, all cops are babies. who cry about fast food and turn it into conflict against cops  
cops ordering food  
its kinna lame you went and googled a photo of his to beef up your argument
THESE COPS LOSE TO FAST FOOD WORKERS ON A DAILY BASIS, IF YOU'RE THIS PARANOID PERHAPS YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A GUN. ARM THE FUCKING ROOFERS AND LANDSCAPERS, LET THEM PROTECT US INSTEAD.  
absolutely losing my mind at hasan putting the cyberpunk 2077 trailer audio over that dumb fox news montage  
this jocko wilnick dude needs to do the opposite of what he's been doing. i'm watching the rogan vid and he should prolly wake up at 8am or something cus my man has the worst takes
ATLA was truly ahead of its time for an animated show airing on a children's network. not only did it have badass disabled characters, indigenous people - diverse representation (all w/o making it the characters only trait) but Korra even had short king representation  
mind boggling how much cops cry about completely made up shit.  
LOL. LOOK AT THAT.    
When I eat too fast at Shake Shack and my tummy hurts  
i'm going to go ahead and be extremely skeptical about this claim considering the long history of cops lying about fast food workers and the mistreatment they get from them.  
i think you‚Äôre missing the point ? yeah it‚Äôs normal conduct - the point is that this level of restrain shown in the apprehension of a white supremacist active shooter can be shown for black people during traffic stops
Ben Shapiro's #1 tactic of debunking systemic racism is just simply denying it exists while simultaneously blaming the racial disparities on individuals doing racist acts (which, according to him, also happen very rarely)

ppl are memeing about emailing noam chomsky, but my discord once wrote a whole ass manifesto about how undemocratic my discord was (and the need hold elections for mods) and got him to reply.
Also I‚Äôm just so confused why everyone wants to resist any criticism of Obama? This isn‚Äôt Star Wars. There is no dark side vs Jedi. Politicians on BOTH the right  amp; the left need to be criticized  amp; held accountable so that they don‚Äôt pander to corporate  amp; neoliberalist agendas
watching steven crowder get absolutely owned and turn full karen  
i wonder what liberals think the system in systemic racism is
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?! Tearing down statues of Winston Churchill?!‚Äù
Well, now that you‚Äôve mentioned it...
Let‚Äôs talk about one of the most widely celebrated genocidal racists in European history.
Thread    
i stand in solidarity with the zoomers
just remembered this classic case of  omg how dare you call them nazis  going terribly wrong  
michael tracey is the type of dude to make fun of  woke  white people saying we should have a separate white people for black lives movement, but then make fun of the solidarity expressed by the majority. maybe he just doesn't like the protests and is horny for attention.  
watching the all lives matter protest from the uk  
uhhh my internet cut out exactly at 11am  right as i was hitting go live wtf is going on.
if a ‚Äúless than lethal‚Äù doesn‚Äôt kill like the cops claim, then a person who steals  one from a cop doesn‚Äôt deserve to be shot in the back while he‚Äôs running away.
mr cummo.
tbf i hate all this shit too and i‚Äôm a fucking boomer  
cops got y‚Äôall conditioned to believe if somebody didn‚Äôt comply they deserve to die
The ramp that I descended after my West Point Commencement speech was very long  amp; steep, had no handrail and, most importantly, was very slippery. The last thing I was going to do is ‚Äúfall‚Äù for the Fake News to have fun with. Final ten feet I ran down to level ground. Momentum!
i‚Äôll be live in the next ten minutes. get in now.  
do y‚Äôall actually think police literally STOP crimes like someone is about to rob you and a cop disguised as a garbage reveals himself and chases The Bad Guy away
