## No one asked for this, yet here it is.
This very unintelligent robot will output a 32 item sentence comprised of 1/3 [HasanAbi](https://twitter.com/hasanthehun) Tweets, 1/3 [Ben Shapiro](https://twitter.com/benshapiro) Tweets and 1/3 [Caroline Calloway](https://twitter.com/carolinecaloway) Tweets. My API access request to twitter was denied so the little program uses the 9,600 most recent tweets (3,200 from each account as of 1/3/2021) exported using this [tool from Vicinitas](https://www.vicinitas.io/free-tools/download-user-tweets). Then I used google documents and notepad++ to delete a lot of useless or non-applicable data then stuffed it all into some big strings. 

It could be a lot better if I sorted my strings into things like nouns, adjectives and verbs. Then I could build some sentence templates which could generate much more cohesive and entertaining results. Who knows, maybe it will happen. For now, the free tools I've tried to automatically sort text into grammar based categories take way too long or hang when given large amounts of word data. I have zero intention of sorting through the tweets manually.

## Run it.
Everytime you [refresh this link](https://crunchrock.github.io/hasan-piroway/) you will get a new generated quote.
If you load it up with Visual Code's live server or another local server or something like that, it will throw errors in node.js.


Thanks for stopping by and have a nice day.
